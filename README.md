# RepGenR

RepGenR (Representative-Genome Repositories) builds dereplicated, representative
genome repositories for large-scale genomic studies. It selects taxa, downloads
genomes, clusters them by average nucleotide identity (ANI), computes
phylogenetic trees, and emits taxonomy files for downstream tools such as
FlexTaxD.

Version 2 is a modular, importable Python package (Python 3.12+) with eight
pluggable tool families and an optional Nextflow pipeline for scatter-gather
runs on HPC and cloud. The largest end-to-end runs recorded are 1157
bacterial genomes (one genus, 12 minutes) and 1256 viral genomes
(Hepeviridae). Larger sizes are measured per tool in the
[scaling audit](docs/audit/scaling-audit.md).

## Pipeline

```
bacterial:         metadata -> genome -> dereplicate -> phylo -> tree2tax
viral:             vmetadata -> vgenome -> dereplicate -> phylo -> tree2tax
local genomes:     ingest -> dereplicate -> phylo -> tree2tax
sequencing reads:  reads -> assemble -> dereplicate -> phylo -> tree2tax
```

`repgenr run` chains a whole row; `repgenr status -wd WD` says what comes next.

`phylo` builds its tree from an alignment it produces with an aligner or a
SNP typer, or directly from the genomes with an alignment-free builder;
`repgenr snptype` runs the SNP typer on its own when the SNP tables are the
deliverable. Each stage is a `repgenr` subcommand and an importable function. Stages
communicate through a single working directory whose state is recorded in
`repgenr.yaml` (provenance) and a SQLite genome manifest.

## Pluggable tools

Tools are discovered through Python entry points; adding one needs no change to
the core (see [docs/developing.md](docs/developing.md)).

| Family | Built-in adapters |
|--------|-------------------|
| Dereplicators | `drep`, `skder`, `galah`, `sourmash` |
| Aligners | `progressivemauve`, `sibeliaz`, `cactus` |
| SNP typers | `simple` (samtools/bcftools), `snippy`, `parsnp`, `ska2` (reference-free) |
| Maskers | `gubbins` (recombination masking via `--mask`) |
| Tree builders | `iqtree`, `fasttree`, `raxmlng` (MSA), `mashtree`, `sourmash` (alignment-free) |
| Assemblers | `skesa`, `shovill` (Illumina), `flye` (ONT, PacBio); used by the reads chain |
| Classifiers | `sourmash` (gather against a GTDB sketch); verifies the organism of an assembled run |
| Polishers | `medaka` (ONT), `racon` with minimap2 (PacBio CLR); correct long-read assemblies in the reads chain |

`repgenr list-tools` prints what is available in your environment.

## Installation

```bash
pip install .                          # the package (Python 3.12+); tools are separate
repgenr list-tools --check             # which tools are found, with versions
```

The tools come from several conda environments on `PATH` or from containers.
`environment.yml` lists them all but does not currently solve as one
environment. The environments, containers (including Apple Silicon) and the
databases some tools need are described in [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

## Quick start

```bash
WD=./francisella
repgenr run -wd $WD -d rep -l genus -tg francisella --tool skder --treebuilder iqtree
repgenr status -wd $WD     # which stages are done, and what to run next
```

`run` chains `metadata -> genome -> dereplicate -> phylo -> tree2tax`; each stage
is also its own subcommand, and `repgenr ingest` starts from genomes already on
disk. `--viral` selects the NCBI Virus path. Re-running a stage is a no-op
unless its parameters or inputs changed (`--force` overrides).

The same pipeline runs as typed Nextflow data channels (no shared working
directory) for HPC and cloud:

```bash
nextflow run nextflow/main.nf -profile standard --outdir results \
    --metadata_args "-r 232.0 --gtdb-version bac120 -d rep -l genus -tg francisella" \
    --derep_tool sourmash --phylo_args "--treebuilder mashtree"
```

`--mode viral` and `--mode reads` (ENA/SRA sequencing runs, one assembly task
per run) select the other two front ends. Nextflow 26.04 or later is required.
