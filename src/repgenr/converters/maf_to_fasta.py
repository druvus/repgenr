"""MAF -> reference-anchored MSA-FASTA.

Projects a MAF (SibeliaZ, MULTIZ, or Cactus via hal2maf) onto the coordinate
system of a chosen reference: within each alignment block, columns where the
reference has a gap are dropped, every other sequence contributes its
gap-trimmed row, and sequences absent from a block are padded with gaps. Blocks
are concatenated in reference order. The result has no insertions relative to
the reference -- a fixed-width MSA suitable for tree inference.
