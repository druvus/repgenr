"""RepGenR command-line interface (entry point).

Replaces the old ``repgenr.py`` string-rewriting dispatcher with a real Typer
app. The app, top-level callback and shared stage harness live in
:mod:`repgenr.cli.base`; the commands are grouped by domain across the
``cmd_*`` modules. Importing those modules here registers their commands on the
single shared ``app``, which the ``repgenr`` console script targets.
