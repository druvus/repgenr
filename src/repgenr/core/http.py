"""Shared HTTP client with retry/backoff for external services.

RepGenR talks to flaky, externally-operated services (the GTDB API and metadata
download, NCBI Entrez). Routing them through one process-wide ``requests.Session``
with a urllib3 retry policy gives every caller the same transient-failure
resilience -- retrying 429/5xx with exponential backoff and honoring
``Retry-After`` -- and the same clean error surface: a failed request raises
:class:`WorkdirError` naming the URL, never a bare ``requests`` traceback. The
streaming :func:`download` additionally verifies the byte count against
``Content-Length`` and writes through a ``.part`` file, so an interrupted
transfer never leaves a truncated file that later parses as if complete.
