"""Genome sketches: one sourmash signature collection per genome of a workdir.

The genome-writing stages (genome, vgenome, ingest, assemble) and the
``repgenr sketch`` command leave ``sketches/<name>.sig.zip`` beside the genome
set, where ``<name>`` is the genome's record name (:func:`record_name`, the
name the aligners and tree builders give it). Each file is a sourmash zip
collection of three DNA signatures, k=21, k=31 and k=51 at scaled=1000 without
abundance, named after the genome, so a consumer can map a signature to its
genome without parsing paths.

Whether a sketch is current is decided from the sha256 of the genome FASTA and
the parameter string recorded with it, not from file times: the manifest holds
both for each genome row (``sketch_file``, ``sketch_params``,
``sketch_digest``); a genome under ``outgroup/`` without a manifest row is
recorded in ``sketches/outgroup.json`` instead.

Sketches are not stage deliverables. A genome set without them is complete;
the stages that compare genomes build their own sketches when these are absent.
Every sketch is written to a hidden temporary file and renamed into place, so
an interrupted run leaves no partial sketch, and the records are written in
batches as the sketches finish, so a rerun sketches only what is missing.
