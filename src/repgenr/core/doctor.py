"""Workdir health checks: verify outputs against records (``repgenr doctor``).

``repgenr status`` reports what ``repgenr.yaml`` claims; ``doctor`` verifies the
claims against the filesystem and the manifest -- interrupted stages, missing or
corrupt genomes, manifest drift, representative/cluster mismatches, truncated
deliverables, unresolvable outgroups, leftover temp files, and stages whose
recorded input digests no longer match reality or whose declared deliverables
are missing (they will re-run).

Read-only: no output, log or record is written in the workdir. Opening the
WAL-mode manifest lets SQLite create or update its ``-shm``/``-wal``
companion files, which hold no data of their own.
