"""Lightweight in-stage parallelism.

The parallel work in RepGenR stages is subprocess-bound (progressiveMauve,
dRep, skani, ...), so a thread pool is the right tool: the GIL is released while
each external tool runs, and threads avoid the pickling constraints that
``multiprocessing`` imposes on closures/adapters. Cross-stage and HPC
parallelism is handled separately by the Nextflow layer.
