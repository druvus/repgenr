"""NCBI Virus data source via the ``datasets`` CLI.

A single ``datasets download virus genome taxon`` call returns both the sequences
(``genomic.fna``) and structured per-sequence metadata (``data_report.jsonl``):
accession, ranked taxonomy, length, completeness, host, segment, isolate. This
replaces the BV-BRC FTP download + the separate NCBI Entrez taxonomy step with
one maintained dependency RepGenR already uses, and yields stable accessions so
viral genomes can adopt the canonical ``Family_Genus_species_Accession`` naming.
