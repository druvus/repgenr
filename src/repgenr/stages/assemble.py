"""assemble stage: fetch the selected sequencing runs, assemble them, and write
the genome contract (``genomes/``, ``selection.tsv``, the manifest).

Each run in ``reads.tsv`` is fetched from the FASTQ locations ENA reported
(a local path is copied instead), verified against its checksum, assembled
with the adapter that accepts its platform and layout, filtered to contigs of
a minimum length, and labelled with the family, genus and species the reads
stage resolved. Runs that cannot be fetched or assembled are written to
``excused_runs.tsv`` so the completeness guard of later stages does not count
them as missing. Finished assemblies carry a marker under ``assemblies/<run>/``
and are skipped on a re-run.
