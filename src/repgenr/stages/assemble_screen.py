"""The reads screen of ``assemble --screen-reads``: three checks on a run's
reads sketch, after the fetch and before an assembler is chosen.

``taxon_mismatch``
    ``sourmash gather`` of the reads sketch (k=31) against the GTDB sketch,
    resolved to a lineage with ``sourmash tax genome`` and the lineages CSV
    (the commands of the post-assembly classifier). The run is excused when
    the GTDB genus differs from the submitted genus, with the classifier's
    ``genus_renamed`` tolerance (family and species epithet agree).
``host_dominated``
    The abundance-weighted fraction of the reads assigned to the top species
    (``f_weighted_at_rank`` of ``tax genome`` at species rank, or the top
    match's ``f_unique_weighted`` when the column is absent) is below the
    minimum fraction.
``duplicate_isolate``
    The reads sketch is contained in the reads sketch of a run accepted
    earlier, of the same taxid or the same biosample, at an ANI estimate at or
    above the duplicate threshold. Runs are compared in ``reads.tsv`` order
    (the largest first), so the larger run is kept.

A tool failure while screening excuses the run as ``screen_failed``, which
says nothing about the data. Each decision is written to
``assemblies/<run>/screen.json`` with the settings it was made with; the
reads sketch and the gather output under ``assemblies/<run>/screen/`` are
kept for an excused run, so the reason can be inspected and a later call with
other thresholds can screen it again without fetching its reads.
