"""Phylogenetics stage: compose an MSA source with a tree builder.

Three orthogonal choices:
  * genome set    -- dereplicated representatives (default) or all genomes
  * MSA source    -- a whole-genome aligner OR a SNP typer's core-SNP alignment
                     (skipped entirely for alignment-free tree builders)
  * tree builder  -- iqtree / fasttree / raxmlng (MSA) or mashtree / sourmash
                     (alignment-free)

The outgroup genome is added to the input set here and passed to builders that
can root (iqtree, raxmlng); the others emit an unrooted tree. Rooting on the
outgroup is done once, for every builder, in the tree2tax stage.

The SNP typing pass (--msa-source snptype) writes under tree/msa/, not snp/:
snp/ belongs to the snptype stage, so the two never replace each other's
tables and each stage's record describes what is on disk.
