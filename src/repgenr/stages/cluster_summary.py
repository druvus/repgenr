"""cluster_summary stage: one row per dereplication representative.

Summarises ``derep/clusters.tsv`` into ``derep/cluster_summary.tsv`` with the
cluster size, the species it spans (from the manifest taxonomy, else parsed
from the canonical filenames),
the manifest CheckM quality of the keeper against its members, and whether the
keeper is a GTDB species representative. The dereplicate
stage writes the file itself; this stage regenerates it for an existing
working directory without rerunning the dereplicator.
