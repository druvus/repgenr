"""tree2tax stage: turn a rooted tree into FlexTaxD-compatible relations.

Turns a rooted tree into a FlexTaxD child->parent table (via dendropy): read
``tree/tree.nwk``, root it on the outgroup unless phylo already did so (or
rooted it at the midpoint, which is kept), name internal nodes (a user basename
or a leaf-derived hash), then emit ``tree2tax.tsv`` (child -> parent) and
``genomes_map.tsv`` (accession -> leaf). Optionally lists redundant
(dereplicated) genomes under their representative leaf, read from the derep
``clusters.tsv`` contract.
