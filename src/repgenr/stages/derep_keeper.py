"""Quality-aware representative selection applied after any dereplicator.

Dereplicators pick representatives by connectivity, first-seen order or tool
defaults, which favours the most-sequenced genotype in a cluster. This step
re-picks each cluster's representative by assembly quality when the manifest
carries CheckM-style completeness and contamination, and leaves the adapter's
choice in place otherwise.

The score follows dRep's default weights for the terms that can be computed
without running tools: completeness - 5 x contamination + 0.5 x log10(N50),
with the N50 read from the genome FASTA. Equal scores are broken by higher
completeness, then lower contamination, then higher N50, then the genome
name, so the choice does not depend on the dereplicator. A genome without
quality never becomes the representative; a scored genome replaces an
unscored representative only when it is high quality (MIMAG: completeness
above 90, contamination below 5).

``--keeper gtdb`` adds one preference before that: a GTDB species
representative in the cluster is kept (:func:`prefer_gtdb_representatives`).
