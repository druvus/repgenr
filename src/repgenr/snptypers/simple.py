"""Built-in 'simple' SNP typer (minimap2 + samtools + bcftools).

A lightweight reference-based core-SNP pipeline that needs no dedicated typing
tool. For each genome: align to the reference (minimap2, assembly preset asm20
by default), call SNP-only variants (bcftools), and build a SNP-only consensus
that preserves reference length. Reference positions where no primary or
supplementary alignment of the genome places a base (outside the alignments,
and within deletions) are set to N in its consensus, so sequence a genome
lacks is recorded as missing rather than as the reference base. The
per-genome consensuses (plus the reference) are stacked into a
whole-genome alignment, then reduced to the columns where at least two of A, C,
G and T occur to form the core-SNP alignment.

Genomes are independent, so they run concurrently: the thread budget becomes
``workers x threads-per-worker``, each worker driving its own chain of tools.
The per-genome intermediates (SAM, BAM, pileup, calls) are scratch. They are
written compressed and deleted as soon as that genome's consensus has been
read, which keeps peak scratch at a few hundred megabytes instead of growing
with the genome count.
