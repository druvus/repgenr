# repgenr: Output

The CLI writes all stage outputs into the shared working directory
(`--workdir`). The Nextflow data-channel pipeline instead flows results between
processes as staged channel files and publishes under `--outdir` (default
`results/`): `metadata/selection.tsv` (or, in reads mode, `reads/reads.tsv`,
`reads/selection.tsv`, `reads/assembly_stats.tsv`, `reads/excused_runs.tsv` and
the `quality.tsv` and `classification.tsv` tables of the QC step), the
dereplication contract under `dereplicate/`, the phylogeny under `phylo/` (the tree and the tree builder's
files under `phylo/tree/`, the alignment it was built from under
`phylo/align/` or `phylo/tree/msa/`), `tree2tax.tsv` and `genomes_map.tsv` at the
top level, and the execution reports under `pipeline_info/`.

## Working directory layout

| Path | Produced by | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `manifest.sqlite` | metadata, ingest, vgenome | Genome manifest (accessions, taxonomy, CheckM quality when known, dereplication status). |
| `selection.tsv` | metadata, ingest, vgenome | The selected genomes: accession, taxonomy, outgroup flag, canonical filename and quality when known. On the NCBI Virus path the species is the current NCBI Taxonomy species of the record's taxid (see usage.md, Viruses). The hand-off every later stage reads, and a resume input. |
| `outgroup_accession.txt` | metadata, ingest, vgenome | Accession of the outgroup genome, read by phylo and tree2tax for rooting. Absent when there is no outgroup. |
| `repgenr.yaml` | all stages | Provenance: tool name, parameters, resolved tool versions, completion timestamps. A tool that reports no version number itself (SibeliaZ) is recorded with the version of the conda package that installed it, read from `conda-meta` in the binary's environment, or as `unknown` without one. A tool run in a container image is recorded with its image reference, and the engine that ran it with the engine's version (`docker: 29.5.3`, or `singularity`, `podman`, `apptainer`); `repgenr versions` and the Nextflow `versions.yml` list the engine once. The metadata record holds the GTDB `release` for the table path; for `--source api`, whose API reports no release number, `release` is null and `api_query_date` holds the UTC time of the query. |
| `repgenr.log` | all stages | Run log. |
| `genomes/` | genome, ingest, vgenome | Genome FASTAs, one per selected accession. `genome` and `vgenome` write `.fasta`; `ingest` stages the source files under their own names, with the suffixes `.fasta`, `.fa`, `.fna`, `.fas`, `.fasta.gz`, `.fna.gz` or `.fa.gz`. |
| `outgroup/` | genome, ingest, vgenome | Outgroup genome for rooting. |
| `ncbi_acc_download_list.txt` | genome | Accessions the download step will fetch, one per line (those without a FASTA in `genomes/`). With `--accession-list-only` it is the only output. |
| `missing_accessions.txt` | genome | Accessions the download did not return, or whose FASTA failed the package checksum; the completeness guard of later stages reads it. |
| `<version>_metadata_r<major>.tsv.gz` (or `.tar.gz`), `<version>_metadata_r<major>.release` | metadata | The downloaded GTDB table (`--source tsv` without `--metadata-path`) and the exact release it was fetched for, which `--nodownload` checks before reusing the table. |
| `reads.tsv` | reads | The selected sequencing runs: run, sample and study accessions, organism and taxid, the resolved family/genus/species tokens, platform, instrument, layout, bases, the FASTQ locations, checksums and sizes ENA reports (empty when ENA holds no FASTQ mirror), and ENA's library selection (RANDOM, MDA, PCR, ...). |
| `assemblies/<run>/` | assemble | Each assembled run's filtered contigs and its `assembly.ok` marker (assembler and polisher, their versions, metrics, and the settings the run was built with); a re-run reuses a run whose settings agree and assembles it again otherwise. With a CheckM2 database, `checkm2.json` stores the run's completeness and contamination with what they were computed from (the SHA-256 of the contigs, the database's resolved path, size and modification time, the CheckM2 version or image); a later call with other `--min-completeness` or `--max-contamination` values applies the stored scores, and CheckM2 runs again only for a run where one of these differs. `--force` reruns the stage but does not bypass the stored scores; to score a run again, delete `assemblies/<run>/checkm2.json`. |
| `assembly_stats.tsv` | assemble | Per-assembly metrics: assembler, contigs, total length, N50, largest contig, estimated coverage, the NCBI taxonomy used for the name, quality and classification columns once those steps run, and the polisher that corrected a long-read assembly. `label_source` is `classifier` when the GTDB tokens name the genome (the genera agree) and `metadata` otherwise. `taxonomy_flag` is empty when the genera agree, `genus_renamed` when the genera differ but the family and the species epithet agree (an NCBI name that GTDB places in another genus of the same family, such as Mycoplasmopsis arginini, GTDB Metamycoplasma arginini; a GTDB suffix such as `_A` is ignored in the comparison), and `classifier_disagrees` for any other difference, including a shared epithet in another family (Klebsiella pneumoniae against Streptococcus pneumoniae). Both flags are warned about, keep the submitted name, and neither excuses the genome; only `classifier_disagrees` counts towards `n_disagree` in the stage record, which records the renames as `n_genus_renamed`. |
| `excused_runs.tsv` | assemble | Runs that produced no genome, with the step that gave up (`fetch`, `assemble`, ...) and the reason; the completeness guard excuses them like `missing_accessions.txt`. Reasons include `no_fastq_mirror`, `download_failed`, `unsupported_platform` (no assembler takes the platform), `unsupported_layout` (the requested assembler takes the platform but not the layout, for example shovill and a run with one FASTQ file), `assembler_not_installed`, `assembly_failed`, `polish_failed` and `qc_failed`. When every run is excused, `assemble` exits 3 and, in the cases described below, leaves an empty genome set. |
| `virus_download_wd/` | vmetadata | Downloaded viral sequences and the metadata tables `vgenome` selects from, and `download.source` naming the source and target of `download.fa`. `virus_metadata_base.tsv` (and `virus_metadata_ncbi.tsv` on the BV-BRC path) at the workdir root are copies of those tables. |
| `assemblies/<run>/` | assemble | Each assembled run's filtered contigs and its `assembly.ok` marker (assembler and polisher, their versions, metrics, and the settings the run was built with); a re-run reuses a run whose settings agree and assembles it again otherwise. |
| `assembly_stats.tsv` | assemble | Per-assembly metrics: assembler, contigs, total length, N50, largest contig, estimated coverage, the NCBI taxonomy used for the name, quality and classification columns once those steps run, and the polisher that corrected a long-read assembly. |
| `excused_runs.tsv` | assemble | Runs that produced no genome, with the step that gave up (`fetch`, `assemble`, ...) and the reason; the completeness guard excuses them like `missing_accessions.txt`. |
| `virus_download_wd/` | vmetadata | Downloaded viral sequences and the metadata tables `vgenome` selects from, and `download.source` naming the source and target of `download.fa`. On the NCBI Virus path `virus_records.json` holds one record per sequence with its report lineage, its species (the current NCBI Taxonomy species of its taxid, else the ICTV binomial from the lineage, else the organism name), `species_source` naming which of the three applied, and the segment label as submitted. `virus_metadata_base.tsv` (and `virus_metadata_ncbi.tsv` on the BV-BRC path) at the workdir root are copies of those tables; on the NCBI Virus path its `name` column is the species and `description` the organism name. |
| `derep/` | dereplicate | Representative genomes and per-tool intermediates. |
| `derep/representatives/` | dereplicate | The representative genomes, one genome file per cluster; the distinct values of the first column of `clusters.tsv`. |
| `derep/unpacked/<representative>/` | derep-unpack | One directory per cluster with its member genomes (and the representative unless `--no-representant`), hard-linked from `genomes/` where the file system allows it and copied otherwise. The directory is named by the representative's file name without its genome extension, or by its full file name when two representatives would otherwise share a directory (`x.fasta` and `x.fna`; names differing only in case). The gzip suffixes (`.fasta.gz`, `.fna.gz`, `.fa.gz`) are removed as a whole. Replaced on each run. |
| `derep/stock/<name>/` | derep-stock | A named, stored dereplication run written by `pack`: `clusters.tsv`, `genome_status.tsv`, `cluster_summary.tsv`, a `representatives/` directory of links to the representative genomes, and `record.json`, the completed `dereplicate` record at pack time (tool, params, tool_versions, completed; absent when there was none). `unpack` restores it, re-stamps the `dereplicate` record from `record.json`, and rebuilds `derep/cluster_summary.tsv` from the restored clusters and the current manifest; the stored summary keeps the quality of pack time. The re-stamped record holds no resume fingerprint, so a later `dereplicate` or `repgenr run` recomputes the restored dereplication; run `phylo` directly to build on it. |
| `glance_clustering_dendrogram.pdf` | glance | Clustering dendrogram over all genomes: dRep's own with `--tool drep`; average-linkage clustering on 1 - ANI with `--tool sourmash`. `--tool auto`, the default, uses dRep when it can run and sourmash otherwise. |
| `glance_MASH_ANI_similarity_boxplot.png`, `glance_MASH_ANI_similarity_histogram.png` | glance | Box plot and histogram of the all-against-all ANI values (Mash ANI from dRep, the sketch-based ANI estimate from sourmash; the axes name which) within `--plot-min`/`--plot-max`, one value per genome pair (self-comparisons left out); the histogram counts genome pairs. A run removes the previous glance plots and dendrogram once the comparison succeeds, so a plot with no values in range is absent rather than stale. |
| `glance_wd/` | glance | Working files of the comparison tool; kept only with `--keep-files`. With `--tool sourmash` it holds `pairwise_ani.csv` (`genome1`, `genome2`, `similarity`, one row per genome pair), `dendrogram_leaves.txt` (the dendrogram's leaf order) and the signatures. |
| `derep/clusters.tsv` | dereplicate | `representative<TAB>member`, one row per genome; a representative also lists itself. |
| `derep/genome_status.tsv` | dereplicate | Per-genome status: `representative`, `contained` or `fail_qc`. |
| `derep/cluster_summary.tsv` | dereplicate, cluster-summary | One row per representative: member count, species spanned and keeper quality against the members (below). |
| `snp/core_snp.fasta` | snptype | Core-SNP (variable-site) alignment; masked in place when `--mask` is set. Only the `snptype` stage writes `snp/`; the typing pass of `phylo --msa-source snptype` writes under `tree/msa/`. |
| `snp/full_alignment.fasta` | snptype | Whole-genome alignment in reference coordinates, when the SNP typer produces one (snippy, parsnp, simple); required input for `--mask`. In the `simple` typer's alignment, reference positions where a genome's alignments place no base (outside them, or in a deletion) are N. |
| `snp/snp_distance_matrix.tsv` | snptype | Pairwise SNP distances between genomes; the `simple` typer writes it, the others do not. Each pair is compared only at sites where both genomes have a base (A, C, G or T); a pair without such a site has `NA`. It is computed before masking, so with `--mask` it counts the recombinant sites that `core_snp.fasta` no longer holds. |
| `scratch/` | genome, assemble, dereplicate, snptype, phylo | Working files, one subdirectory per stage; the typing pass of `phylo --msa-source snptype` uses `phylo_snptype/`, which holds the same kinds of files as `snptype/` and is cleared when phylo types again. The files under `genome_download/` and `assemble/` are removed unless `--keep-files`. `dereplicate/` holds the dereplicator's working files (sketches, pairwise tables); it is kept after the run and cleared when `dereplicate` runs again. Under `snptype/`, each genome's intermediates are removed once its consensus has been read; a genome whose chain failed keeps its own. The `ska2` typer keeps its split k-mer file (`split_kmers.skf`) and sample list there, and `parsnp` its output directory and `input_genomes/` (links to the genomes where the file system allows, copies otherwise); they are left in place and cleared when `snptype` runs again. |
| `align/msa.fasta` | phylo | Whole-genome alignment from the aligner (`--msa-source aligner`). Each record is named by the genome file name without its FASTA suffix and `.gz`. |
| `align/msa_source.json`, `tree/msa/msa_source.json` | phylo | Stamp beside the alignment phylo built: the genome set, the source settings and the alignment's digest, so a later `phylo` that changes only the tree builder reuses it. A `snp/msa_source.json` was written by phylo versions that typed into `snp/`; it is no longer read, such a workdir is typed once more into `tree/msa/`, and `doctor` warns that the tables in `snp/` may be phylo's. |
| `tree/` | phylo | Phylogeny (`tree.nwk`) and the tree builder's own files (logs, bootstrap trees). A rebuild removes the previous builder's files but keeps `msa/`, the reuse cache of the SNP typing pass. |
| `tree/msa/` | phylo | With `--msa-source snptype`: the alignment phylo's own typing pass produced, outgroup included (`core_snp.fasta`, with `full_alignment.fasta`, `snp_distance_matrix.tsv` or `variants.vcf` when the typer writes them, masked in place with `--mask`), and its reuse stamp. It is a reuse cache: after a switch to `--msa-source aligner` or an alignment-free builder it may remain from an earlier snptype-source run, and it then does not describe the current tree; a later return to the same source and settings reuses it. |
| `segments.tsv` | vgenome | With `--group-segments`: each grouped isolate's token and its member segment accessions, one row per member, with the normalised segment (`segment`) and the label as submitted (`segment_label`). Absent otherwise. |
| `genomes_map.tsv` | tree2tax | Accession to leaf: each representative, its dereplicated members, and for a grouped viral isolate its member segment accessions. |
| `tree2tax.tsv` | tree2tax | FlexTaxD-compatible taxonomy derived from the tree. |

## When every sequencing run is excused

When `assemble` accepts no run, it exits 3, `status` shows the stage as
interrupted, and `excused_runs.tsv` gives the reasons. What happens to the
genome set already in the working directory depends on who wrote it and on
whether any run was judged:

- **Written by an earlier `assemble` call, and at least one run judged.** A
  run counts as judged when it was assembled, polished or quality-checked and
  rejected, or refused by the assembler (`assembly_failed`, `polish_failed`,
  `qc_failed`, `unsupported_platform`, `unsupported_layout`). The set is
  emptied: a warning is logged first, then `genomes/` is emptied,
  `selection.tsv` keeps only its header, the manifest lists no genomes,
  `assembly_stats.tsv` is removed, and the outgroup that call staged is
  removed with `outgroup_accession.txt`. `dereplicate` then refuses with
  exit 3 (no genome files) rather than run on the earlier set; the outputs of
  an earlier `dereplicate` and `phylo` stay until those stages run again.
- **Written by an earlier `assemble` call, but no run judged.** When every
  excuse is `download_failed`, `no_fastq_mirror` or `assembler_not_installed`
  (ENA unreachable, say), the set is kept and the error says so; rerun with
  `--force` once the cause is resolved.
- **Written by another stage** (`genome`, `ingest`, `vgenome`; any manifest
  row whose source is not `sra`) or not recorded in the manifest. The set and
  its outgroup are kept, and the error names their sources.
- **Under `--append`.** Nothing is removed; the existing selection stays as
  it was.
- **No set present** (a first call). Nothing is written: no `genomes/`, no
  `selection.tsv`, no manifest.

The finished runs under `assemblies/` always stay, so a later call with other
settings (a looser quality gate, say) reuses them.

## Cluster summary

`derep/cluster_summary.tsv` condenses `clusters.tsv` into one row per
representative, largest cluster first and then by representative name.
`dereplicate` writes it after every run
and `repgenr cluster-summary -wd <workdir>` regenerates it for an existing
working directory from `clusters.tsv` and the manifest, without rerunning the
dereplicator. The outgroup is set aside before dereplication and has
no row.

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `representative` | Keeper filename, as in `clusters.tsv`. |
| `n_members` | Genomes contained under the keeper; the keeper itself is not counted, so a cluster of 20 genomes reads 19 (`clusters.tsv` lists the keeper as a member of itself). |
| `n_species` | Distinct species across keeper and members. The species comes from the manifest taxonomy (`selection.tsv` in the Nextflow steps) and, for a genome without one, from its canonical filename. A genome with neither adds no species, so a cluster of such genomes reports 0. Species are told apart by genus and epithet. |
| `species` | Those species, comma-separated: the keeper's first, then by number of genomes and name. At most five are listed, followed by `+N more`; `n_species` gives the full count. An epithet shared by two genera is written with its genus, for example `Escherichia coli`. |
| `rep_completeness`, `rep_contamination` | CheckM values of the keeper from the manifest; blank when unknown. |
| `member_max_completeness`, `member_min_contamination` | Best values among the scored members; blank when no member is scored. |
| `best_member` | Highest-scoring genome in the cluster by completeness minus five times contamination, keeper included. Equals `representative` when the keeper is already the best; blank when nothing in the cluster is scored. |
| `n_genomes` | Genomes in the cluster, the keeper included (`n_members` + 1). It is the last column, so the positions of the earlier columns are unchanged. |

The species columns come from the manifest taxonomy (`selection.tsv` in the
Nextflow steps), and from the canonical filename
(`Family_genus_species_ACCESSION.fasta`) for a genome without one. A genome
with neither adds no species. In a cluster of one
species `n_species` is 1. A larger value means the cluster joins several
species, or, for names such as the synthetic benchmark sets, that every genome
has its own species token. With no quality in the manifest (for example after
`ingest` without `--selection` columns) the four quality columns and
`best_member` are blank and the command logs that it left them blank.

To list the members of a cluster, see "Finding the members of a cluster" in
[usage.md](usage.md#inspecting-a-dereplication).

A row whose `best_member` differs from its `representative` marks a cluster
where a member outscores the keeper. This is expected under `--keeper tool`,
and can also follow `--reduce`, which merges representatives by taxon. The
quality columns come from the manifest in the workdir CLI and from
`--selection-tsv` in the Nextflow steps; without either they stay blank and
the size and species columns still apply.

## Machine-readable status

`repgenr status --json` and `repgenr doctor --json` print one JSON object on
stdout and nothing else; log messages go to stderr. The `schema` key names the
format and its version, and a change that removes or renames a key raises the
version. The exit codes are the same as without `--json`: on exit 3 (a missing
workdir, or for `status` a malformed `repgenr.yaml`) stdout is empty and the
error is on stderr, so a caller checks the exit code before parsing. Scripts
should key on `level`, `area`, `state`, `pipeline` and `next`; the `message`,
`reason`, `detail` and `notes` texts are meant for people and may change
wording between releases.

`status`:

```json
{
  "schema": "repgenr.status/1",
  "repgenr": "2.1.0",
  "workdir": "/data/wd",
  "pipeline": "local",
  "stages": [
    {"name": "ingest", "in_chain": true, "state": "done", "reason": null,
     "tool": null, "completed": "2026-10-08T07:22:34+00:00",
     "fingerprint": true, "detail": null},
    {"name": "dereplicate", "in_chain": true, "state": "stale",
     "reason": "input changed: genomes", "tool": "sourmash",
     "completed": "2026-10-08T07:30:00+00:00", "fingerprint": true,
     "detail": null},
    {"name": "phylo", "in_chain": true, "state": "pending", "reason": null,
     "tool": null, "completed": null, "fingerprint": false, "detail": null}
  ],
  "next": "dereplicate",
  "notes": [],
  "unchecked": null
}
```

- `pipeline` is `bacterial`, `viral`, `local` or `reads` (the lineage `status`
  follows). It is null when the workdir has no `repgenr.yaml` or the record
  holds no stage (`stages` is then empty and `notes` names the entry stages),
  and when stages are recorded but no entry stage (`stages` then follows
  dereplicate, phylo and tree2tax).
- `stages` lists the stages of that lineage in order (`in_chain` true), then
  any other recorded stage (`in_chain` false), such as `snptype` or `glance`.
- `state` is `done`, `stale` (completed, but an input changed or an output is
  missing; `reason` says which), `interrupted` (started and did not finish) or
  `pending` (not run).
- `fingerprint` is true when the record holds a resume fingerprint. A `done`
  stage without one (written by an older version, or restored by
  `derep-stock --action unpack`) is recomputed by its next invocation. `detail`
  holds the GTDB release or API query date of `metadata`, else null.
- `next` is the first stage of the lineage that is not done, or null when all
  are. `notes` holds advice about that stage, for example that `phylo` will
  refuse too few representatives.
- `unchecked` is null, or the error that stopped the staleness check; the
  states are then based on the records alone.

`doctor`:

```json
{
  "schema": "repgenr.doctor/1",
  "repgenr": "2.1.0",
  "workdir": "/data/wd",
  "quick": false,
  "findings": [
    {"level": "fail", "area": "genomes",
     "message": "1 selected genome(s) missing from /data/wd/genomes (e.g. GCF_2.1); re-run genome."},
    {"level": "ok", "area": "metadata", "message": "completed 2026-10-08T07:22:34+00:00"}
  ],
  "counts": {"fail": 1, "warn": 0, "ok": 1},
  "exit_code": 7
}
```

- `level` is `fail`, `warn` or `ok`; findings are ordered failures first, then
  warnings, then the rest, each group by `area`, as in the text report.
- `area` is a stage name (`dereplicate`, `phylo`) or a topic such as
  `config`, `genomes`, `manifest`, `outgroup`, `leftovers` or `summary`. A
  check that raised an error is reported as a `fail` in an area named after
  the check (for example `tree` or `manifest_drift`), with a message starting
  "Check could not complete".
- `exit_code` is the status the command exits with: 7 when `counts.fail` is
  above zero, else 0.
- `quick` is true under `--quick`; the genome files were then not read, and a
  non-FASTA file under a FASTA name is not reported.

## Pipeline information

Under `<outdir>/pipeline_info/`, each run writes timestamped Nextflow execution
reports:

- `execution_report_*.html` -- resource usage and per-task summary.
- `execution_timeline_*.html` -- task timeline.
- `execution_trace_*.txt` -- machine-readable trace of every task.
- `pipeline_dag_*.html` -- the workflow DAG.
- `software_versions.yml` -- every process's resolved tool versions, collected
  and de-duplicated from each process's `versions.yml` fragment.

These are useful for diagnosing resource limits (the retry strategy scales
memory and time per attempt) and for provenance.
