# Usage

## Introduction

RepGenR builds a representative-genome repository for a taxonomic group and the
matching FlexTaxD taxonomy. The pipeline runs five stages in order:

1. **metadata** -- select genome accessions (GTDB for bacteria/archaea; the
   viral path uses `vmetadata`/`vgenome`, sourcing from NCBI Virus by default).
2. **genome** -- download and organise the selected genomes with NCBI Datasets.
3. **dereplicate** -- cluster genomes by ANI and pick representatives.
4. **phylo** -- build a phylogeny from the representatives.
5. **tree2tax** -- emit a FlexTaxD-compatible taxonomy from the tree.

The CLI can also start from genomes already on disk: `repgenr ingest` stands
in for the first two stages (see "Starting from local genomes" below).

The Nextflow layer runs these stages as typed data channels: each stage emits its
outputs (the metadata selection, genome FASTAs, per-chunk and merged
representatives, the tree, the taxonomy) as staged files that the next stage
consumes. There is no shared working directory; results are published under
`--outdir`. Nextflow owns the fan-out (scatter-gather dereplication).

This page covers the command line first, then the Nextflow layer, running the
tools in containers, and troubleshooting. [install.md](install.md) explains how
to install the package and the external tools. [choosing-tools.md](choosing-tools.md)
explains which dereplicator, phylogeny route and tree builder suit a dataset. Every command and option is listed in
[cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md); the files each stage writes are described
in [output.md](output.md).

## Command line

Every stage command takes the working directory with `-wd` (long form
`--workdir`). Stages read and write inside it, and `repgenr.yaml` there records
what ran. Large run-time data (scratch, downloads, the Cactus job store) also
lives under the working directory and `TMPDIR`, so put it on a disk with room.

Commands that run a threaded tool take `-t/--threads`. Without it the count is
16, or the CPU limit of the repgenr process when that is lower: the CPUs it may
run on (a Slurm cpuset, `taskset`) and a cgroup CPU quota (`docker run --cpus`,
a Kubernetes CPU limit), rounded up. A lowered default is reported once on
the console. An explicit `-t` is used as given, with a warning when it exceeds
that limit. The thread count is not a result parameter, so changing it does
not make a finished stage rerun.

### Bacteria

```bash
WD=./francisella

# Full GTDB table (release-pinned):
repgenr metadata -wd $WD -r 232.0 --gtdb-version bac120 -d rep -l genus -tg francisella
# Or query just the target taxon via the GTDB API (no full-table download):
repgenr metadata -wd $WD --source api -d rep -l genus -tg francisella

repgenr genome -wd $WD
repgenr dereplicate -wd $WD --tool skder -t 16
repgenr phylo -wd $WD --aligner progressivemauve --treebuilder iqtree
repgenr tree2tax -wd $WD --include-dereplicated
```

`--metadata-path <table>` reads a GTDB metadata table you already have instead
of downloading one; a path that does not exist exits 2. With `--source tsv`
(the default) `-r/--release` (major.minor, e.g. `232.0`) and `--gtdb-version`
(`bac120` or `ar53`) are still required, because they select the table's
release and domain and are recorded in the provenance.

The downloaded table stays in the workdir (`bac120_metadata_r232.tsv.gz`), and
`--nodownload` reuses it instead of downloading it again. Table names carry
only the major release, so a download also writes
`<version>_metadata_r<major>.release` with the exact release, and
`--nodownload` refuses a table fetched for another minor release (exit 2). A
table without that file, for instance one placed by hand, is reused with a
warning. The download is checked against its size and against GTDB's
`MD5SUM.txt`; a checksum mismatch removes the file and exits 3. A release or
version that GTDB does not publish exits 2 after trying the current
(`.tsv.gz`) and the legacy (`.tar.gz`) layout; a network failure exits 3 with
its cause and does not try the second layout.

`--source api` serves GTDB's current release and ignores `-r`, `--gtdb-version`,
`--metadata-path` and `--nodownload` (a warning names them). The API does not
report a release number, so the stage record holds `release: null` and, in its
place, `api_query_date`, the UTC time of the query (ISO 8601). `status` shows
it after the metadata line and `versions` prints it as `gtdb_api_query_date`;
for the table path they show the release (`gtdb_release`). To relate a query
date to a GTDB release, compare it with the release dates on the GTDB website. GTDB taxon names
are case-sensitive: the target's first letter is raised and a species epithet
is lowered, so `-tg francisella -ts Tularensis` finds `s__Francisella
tularensis`; suffixes such as `Bacillus_A` or `copri_A` must be typed as GTDB
spells them. A taxon or `--outgroup-accession` the API does not know exits 2.
A named outgroup must lie outside the target taxon on both sources, like the
automatic one (exit 2 otherwise); a target genome that `-d rep` or `--limit`
left out of the selection is still not an outgroup.

Or run the whole chain in one command (bacterial by default; `--viral` for the
NCBI Virus path), then check progress at any time:

```bash
repgenr run -wd $WD -d rep -l genus -tg francisella --tool skder --treebuilder iqtree
repgenr status -wd $WD     # which stages are done, and what to run next
```

`run` forwards the stage options it shares a name with; for the rest, run
the stage command by hand (`repgenr status` says which comes next). Two
worth knowing: `--with-snptype` adds the standalone `snptype` stage after
dereplication, so the SNP tables under `snp/` are produced even when the tree
is built another way, and `--genomes-dir` starts the chain from local genomes.
With `--msa-source snptype`, `phylo` runs its own typing pass, outgroup
included, into `tree/msa/`; `snp/` holds only the `snptype` stage's tables, so
the two do not replace each other and a later `phylo` run that changes only the
tree builder reuses its alignment.

### Starting from local genomes

`repgenr ingest -wd WD --genomes-dir DIR` populates a working directory from
local FASTA files instead of downloading: files are linked (or copied with
`--copy`) into `genomes/`, `selection.tsv` and the SQLite manifest are written
in the same format `metadata`/`genome` produce, and the stage is recorded so
`status` reports the local chain (`ingest -> dereplicate -> phylo -> tree2tax`)
and a second `ingest` on an unchanged directory skips. Taxonomy and quality
columns come from `--selection selection.tsv` when given, otherwise from the
canonical `Family_genus_species_ACCESSION.fasta` filename. `--outgroup` sets
one genome aside (a name under `--genomes-dir`, or a path to a FASTA file
elsewhere) under `outgroup/` and writes `outgroup_accession.txt`, so `phylo`
roots on it exactly as after a download. This is the CLI counterpart of the
Nextflow harness `nextflow/tests/local_dataflow.nf`, which takes a genome
directory straight into `DEREPLICATE_SCATTER`.

```bash
repgenr ingest -wd $WD --genomes-dir ./my_genomes --outgroup GCF_003574425.1
repgenr dereplicate -wd $WD --tool skder
repgenr phylo -wd $WD --treebuilder mashtree
repgenr tree2tax -wd $WD --include-dereplicated
```

`repgenr run --genomes-dir ./my_genomes ...` runs the same local chain in
one command; `--from-workdir`, `--selection`, `--outgroup` and `--copy` pass
through to `ingest`, and the GTDB selection flags are not needed.

`--outgroup` names a genome under `--genomes-dir` or in a `--from-workdir`
(filename, stem or accession) or a FASTA file anywhere; it is staged under `outgroup/` and kept
out of the ingroup. When `--selection` also marks an outgroup row, both must
name the same genome; otherwise `ingest` exits 2 and names both. A file from
outside `--genomes-dir` whose name gives the filename or accession of an
ingroup genome is refused (exit 2), since it would replace that genome.

Without `--selection`, accession and taxonomy come from the filename:

- `Family_genus_species_ACCESSION.fasta` (four or more `_`-separated tokens)
  gives the first three tokens as taxonomy and the rest as the accession.
  Any name with four or more tokens is read this way, so
  `sample_1_run_A.fasta` gives the accession `A`.
- A name that starts with an NCBI assembly accession
  (`GCF_000008985.1_ASM898v1_genomic.fna`, as NCBI Datasets and the FTP site
  deliver) gives that accession and no taxonomy.
- Any other name gives no taxonomy and the file stem as the accession.

Two genomes with one accession (for example `x.fasta` and `x.fna`, or two
four-token names that end alike) stop `ingest` with exit 2; give them
distinct accessions with `--selection`. The `is_outgroup` column of a
selection takes `1`/`0` (also `true`/`false`, `yes`/`no`), and so does the
optional `gtdb_representative` column, which `--keeper gtdb` reads; without
that column no genome is a GTDB representative.

Only the files directly under `--genomes-dir` with a suffix `.fasta`, `.fa`,
`.fna`, `.fas`, `.fasta.gz`, `.fna.gz` or `.fa.gz` are read, so the
`.fna.gz` files of the NCBI FTP site can be ingested as they are; other files
(`X.FASTA`, `x.fas.gz`) are listed in a warning and skipped. Compressed
genomes are staged unchanged, and every tool accepts them. The dereplicators
(sourmash, skDER, galah; dRep through a decompressed copy), cactus, the
`mashtree` and `sourmash` tree builders and the `ska2` and `simple` typers
read gzip themselves. progressiveMauve, SibeliaZ, `parsnp` and `snippy`
cannot (they crashed or wrote an empty alignment before this was handled), so
`snptype` and `phylo` give them a decompressed copy of each gzipped genome in
the stage's scratch directory (`scratch/snptype/inputs/`,
`scratch/phylo_snptype/inputs/` or `scratch/phylo_inputs/`) and remove the
copies when the tool has finished. The scratch directory therefore needs
room for the uncompressed genomes while the tool runs; the stage checks the
free space first (about four times the gzip size) and stops when less than
1 GB is free. A truncated or corrupt gzip genome stops the stage with exit 2
naming the file. The copies keep the
genome's record name, so alignments and trees are the same as for
uncompressed files.
Subdirectories are not searched (an NCBI Datasets download keeps each genome
in its own directory, so collect the `.fna` files into one directory first). An empty or unreadable genome
file (a dangling link included) stops `ingest` with exit 2 before anything is
staged, and the record of an earlier `ingest` is left as it was; `doctor`
checks that the staged files hold FASTA.

By default `genomes/` holds symbolic links to the source files, which takes
under a second for 1000 genomes. If the source is later moved or deleted the
links dangle: `doctor` reports them, and `ingest` from the new location
restages the set. `--copy` makes the working directory independent of the
source (2 GB, 1000 genomes, from an exFAT disk took about 2.5 minutes); the
copies keep the source's permissions, so read-only sources give read-only
copies. A changed source (files added, removed or rewritten) re-runs `ingest`
on its next invocation, prunes genomes no longer present, and marks
`dereplicate` and later stages for a re-run; an unchanged set keeps the
dereplication status recorded in the manifest.

#### Combining working directories

`--from-workdir WD` (repeatable, alone or together with `--genomes-dir`)
takes the genome set of an earlier working directory: the rows of its
`selection.tsv` and the files they name under its `genomes/`. This combines
genomes selected from GTDB in one working directory with genomes assembled
from sequencing runs in another, so that both are dereplicated together:

```bash
# GTDB genomes
repgenr metadata -wd WD1 --source api -d all -l species -tg francisella -ts tularensis
repgenr genome -wd WD1
# Assemblies from sequencing runs
repgenr reads -wd WD2 -ts "Francisella tularensis" --platform illumina
repgenr assemble -wd WD2 --checkm2-db /db/checkm2/uniref100.KO.1.dmnd \
    --gtdb-sketch /db/gtdb/gtdb-rs226-reps.k31.sig.zip
# Both sets in a third working directory
repgenr ingest -wd WD3 --from-workdir WD1 --from-workdir WD2 --outgroup GCF_003574425.1
repgenr dereplicate -wd WD3 --tool skder --keeper gtdb
```

What carries over from each source row is its accession, taxonomy, filename,
CheckM completeness and contamination, and `gtdb_representative`, so
`--keeper quality` and `--keeper gtdb` work on the combined set. The manifest
keeps the source of each genome (`gtdb`, `sra`, `local` and so on) when the
source working directory has a manifest, and records `local` when it does not;
genomes from `--genomes-dir` are `local`. `--selection` applies to
`--genomes-dir` only. Per-run files of the reads working directory
(`assembly_stats.tsv`, `excused_runs.tsv`, `reads.tsv`) stay there and are
not copied.

The outgroup of a source working directory is not carried over; `ingest`
logs one line for each source that had one. `--outgroup` sets the outgroup of
the new working directory and may name a genome of any source (filename, stem
or accession, under `genomes/` or `outgroup/` of a source working directory,
or under `--genomes-dir`), or a FASTA file elsewhere. A genome found in two
sources (the same accession, or the same filename with different accessions)
stops `ingest` with exit 2 and names both sources; neither takes precedence.
A selection row whose file is missing, or a `--from-workdir` that is the
target working directory, also exits 2. The selection and the `genomes/`
directory of each source are resume inputs, so a change in a source working
directory reruns `ingest`; the source manifest is not, so a change of a
source label alone needs `--force`.

`assemble --append` is the alternative within one working directory: it adds
the assemblies to the GTDB selection already there.

### Starting from sequencing reads

`repgenr reads` selects whole-genome sequencing runs from ENA (which mirrors
SRA) and writes `reads.tsv`; `repgenr assemble` fetches and assembles them
into `genomes/` with the same `selection.tsv` and manifest the other entry
paths write, so the chain is `reads -> assemble -> dereplicate -> phylo ->
tree2tax`. Runs are chosen by taxon
(`--target-family`/`-tf`, `--target-genus`/`-tg` or `--target-species`/`-ts`,
resolved through the ENA taxonomy, synonyms included) or by accession: `--accession` takes a run (SRR/ERR/DRR), a sample
(SAMN.., SRS..) or a study (PRJNA.., SRP..) and repeats; `--accession-file`
lists them one per line (text from a `#` to the end of the line is a
comment). `--platform illumina|ont|pacbio` keeps one platform, `--min-bases` drops small runs, `--max-bases` drops runs above a
size (an unenriched whole-host library, tens of Gb for a 1 Mb endosymbiont,
would assemble into a host-dominated genome), `--drop-selection` drops runs
by ENA library selection (default `MDA`, whole-genome amplification, which
assembles into chimeric and uneven contigs; repeat the flag for more values,
`--drop-selection none` keeps every run; the value is kept in `reads.tsv` as
`library_selection`), `--one-per-sample` (the default)
keeps the best run of each sample: a long-read run when it carries at least
100 Mb and a tenth of the sample's largest short-read run, else the largest
run (`--all-runs` keeps every run); `--max-runs` caps the selection to the
largest runs. Runs found by accession pass the same filter as the taxon
query, whole-genome sequencing of genomic DNA: RNA-Seq, amplicon or
metagenomic runs of a named study or sample are dropped with a warning that
names them. At assembly, a paired run that ENA lists with a third, orphan
FASTQ file is given to skesa as the pair plus the orphan file, and to shovill
as the pair only. Each run is labelled with the family, genus and species of
its NCBI taxid, in the same filename tokens the GTDB path uses. Which assembler
and polisher suit each sequencing platform is in
[choosing-tools.md](choosing-tools.md#7-assemblers-and-polishers).

```bash
repgenr reads -wd $WD -ts "Francisella tularensis" --platform illumina --max-runs 20
repgenr reads -wd $WD --accession PRJNA954307 --accession SRR28800588
repgenr assemble -wd $WD --assembler auto -t 16 --jobs 2
# or the whole chain:
repgenr run -wd $WD --reads -ts "Francisella tularensis" --platform illumina --max-runs 20 \
    --assembler skesa --treebuilder mashtree
```

`assemble` downloads each run's FASTQ files from the locations ENA lists
(over HTTPS, verified against ENA's checksums), assembles them, keeps the
contigs of at least `--min-contig-length` bases (500) renamed
`<run>_contig<n>`, and names the genome `Family_genus_species_RUN.fasta` from
the tokens the reads stage resolved. `--assembler auto` (the default) picks
by platform and layout: `skesa` for Illumina, `shovill` (SPAdes) as the
alternative for paired Illumina, `flye` for Oxford Nanopore and PacBio;
`--tool-arg` passes tuning such as `mode=nano-raw` to Flye. `--jobs` runs
that many assemblies at once with `--threads` split across them; memory,
not CPU, is the limit, so the default is 2, or 1 as soon as a long-read run
is pending. `--memory-gb` is the RAM cap passed to SKESA and shovill (shovill
accepts no less than 8). Each finished run leaves a marker under
`assemblies/<run>/`, so an interrupted stage resumes without refetching;
reads are deleted after a successful assembly unless `--keep-reads`, and the
assembler's scratch unless `--keep-files`. A run interrupted during its
assembly keeps the FASTQ files that still match their checksum, so the
resume does not download them again. The marker records the settings the
run was built with (`--assembler`, `--polisher`, `--polish-rounds`,
`--min-contig-length` and the `--tool-arg` keys its tools read). A later
call, `--force` included, reuses a finished run only while these agree. A
higher `--min-contig-length` filters the finished contigs again, which gives
the same result as filtering the raw assembly. Any other change assembles
the run again, and the log names the change. To assemble a run again under
the same settings, delete `assemblies/<run>/`. A marker written before
the settings were recorded is reused as it is, filtered at the requested
floor. A run without an ENA FASTQ
mirror, one whose download fails its checksum, one no assembler accepts
(`unsupported_platform`), one whose assembler is not installed under
`--assembler auto` (`assembler_not_installed`, with a warning naming the
adapters that would take it), or one whose assembly fails is written to
`excused_runs.tsv` with the reason and the rest proceed; the completeness
guard of later stages excuses those runs. When no run can be assembled
because no assembler is installed, the stage exits 4 instead. A repeat with
the same settings skips the stage, so a run whose download failed is
retried only with `--force`; the closing warning names such runs. Long-read
runs are assembled whatever layout ENA gives them (some ONT runs are
labelled PAIRED), and the polishers join a run listed as several FASTQ
files into one. A short-read run that ENA labels PAIRED but lists with a
single FASTQ file (mate-1 reads only, for example) is planned as single-end:
`auto` assembles it with SKESA, and `--assembler shovill`, which needs a read
pair, excuses it as `unsupported_layout` before anything is downloaded. The
log names each such run.
`--outgroup FASTA` sets a genome aside for rooting, as `ingest --outgroup`
does. Per-assembly metrics (contigs, total length, N50, coverage from the
sequenced bases) are in `assembly_stats.tsv`.

`assemble --append` adds the assemblies to a working directory that already
holds a selection from `metadata` and `genome` (or `ingest`): the existing
rows, genome files and outgroup stay, a run assembled earlier is replaced,
and the manifest gains the new genomes with source `sra`, so a mixed GTDB
and reads-derived set dereplicates together. Because `metadata` and `ingest`
replace the selection and the genome stage prunes what the manifest no
longer lists, both refuse to re-run while appended genomes are present;
`--drop-foreign` discards them deliberately, and `assemble --append` can put
them back afterwards. An `ingest` that takes the same genomes again with
`--from-workdir` does not drop them and is not refused. Genomes with source
`sra` that an earlier `ingest --from-workdir` brought in are not protected
this way, unless `assemble` has also run in that working directory. To keep
the two sets in separate working directories instead, combine them with
`ingest --from-workdir` (see "Combining working directories").

Long-read assemblies are polished with the run's own reads before the
contig filter: `--polisher auto` (the default) runs medaka for ONT runs
(racon when medaka is not installed) and racon (minimap2 overlaps, `--polish-rounds` rounds) for PacBio CLR runs, and
nothing for PacBio HiFi or Illumina; `--polisher none` turns it off. medaka
needs the basecaller model. Reads basecalled with Dorado name it in their
FASTQ headers and medaka resolves it from there; reads mirrored through SRA
have their headers rewritten and never do, so for them give the model with
`--tool-arg model=...` or the default applies: ONT's bacterial
methylation-aware model for R10.4.1 400 bps chemistry, the usual case for
public bacterial ONT runs since 2023 (`--tool-arg bacteria=false` uses
medaka's general default model instead). The marker records which of the
three applied. A polishing failure
excuses the run with `polish_failed`; `assembly_stats.tsv` names the
polisher per genome. When `--polisher auto` finds an adapter for a run but
its tool is not installed, the run is assembled unpolished and one warning
per platform names the adapters. Unpolished ONT assemblies carry indel errors that break
genes, which CheckM2 reads as lower completeness and higher contamination.

Two optional checks run on the assemblies. With a CheckM2 database
(`--checkm2-db`, or the `CHECKM2DB` variable CheckM2 itself reads; obtain it
with `checkm2 database --download`), every assembly is scored, the
completeness and contamination reach `selection.tsv` and the manifest (so
`--keeper quality` works as it does for GTDB genomes), and an assembly below
`--min-completeness` (50) or above `--max-contamination` (10) is excused with
`qc_failed`. An assembly for which CheckM2 reports no result is kept with a
warning and without quality values. The scores are stored per run
(`assemblies/<run>/checkm2.json`) with the contigs' SHA-256, the database's
resolved path and size and the CheckM2 version (the image under
`--container`), so a later call that changes only `--min-completeness` or
`--max-contamination` applies the stored scores without running CheckM2
again (about 5 minutes for two genomes under emulation); a run whose contigs,
database (path, size or modification time) or CheckM2 version differ is
scored again. `--force` reruns the stage but does not bypass the stored scores; to score a run again, delete `assemblies/<run>/checkm2.json`. With a GTDB sourmash sketch (`--gtdb-sketch` and
`--gtdb-lineages`, or `REPGENR_GTDB_SKETCH` and `REPGENR_GTDB_LINEAGES`; the
`gtdb-rs226-reps.k31-sc10k.sig.zip` sketch and its `lineages.csv` from
`https://farm.cse.ucdavis.edu/~ctbrown/sourmash-db/gtdb-rs226/` serve), each
assembly is classified by `sourmash gather` (`--classifier auto` runs it when
a sketch is configured; `none` never). When the GTDB genus agrees with the
submitted organism, the GTDB family, genus and species name the genome file,
so a reads-derived genome groups with GTDB-downloaded ones; otherwise the
submitted name stays and `assembly_stats.tsv` flags the genome. The flag is
`genus_renamed` when the genus differs but the family and the species
epithet agree, so GTDB has moved the species to another genus of the same
family (NCBI Mycoplasmopsis arginini is GTDB Metamycoplasma arginini), and
`classifier_disagrees` for any other difference, including a shared epithet
in another family (Klebsiella pneumoniae against Streptococcus pneumoniae).
Both are warned about, neither excuses the genome, and only
`classifier_disagrees` counts as a disagreement in the stage record. Both lineages are kept in that table, and the sketch
release is recorded in provenance next to the metadata release. The database
paths and the checkm2 and sourmash binaries are checked before any run is
fetched, so a wrong path exits 2 and a missing tool exits 4 at once rather
than after the assemblies. sourmash runs one gather per assembly; with the
GTDB rs226 representatives sketch each holds about 0.6 GB of memory (eight at
once peaked at 4.3 GB), so as many run at once as both `--threads` and
`--memory-gb` / 0.6 allow (16 GB, the default, allows 26; at least one runs).
The log names the number chosen. `genome-qc` takes the same `--memory-gb`, and
the Nextflow module passes the task's memory. Without a
database the checks are skipped and the log says so. `run --reads` forwards
`--accession-file`, `--platform`, `--max-runs`, `--assembler`, `--threads`
and `--outgroup`; the rest is available on the stage commands.

The same work is available as three stateless steps, which the Nextflow reads
mode runs as separate tasks and which also serve a scheduler of your own:

```bash
repgenr reads -wd $WD -tg mycoplasmopsis --platform illumina --max-runs 20
# one task per run: fetch, assemble, filter contigs
repgenr assemble-run --reads-tsv $WD/reads.tsv --run SRR25474756 -o asm/SRR25474756 \
    --assembler auto -t 8 --memory-gb 16 --min-contig-length 500
# one batch: CheckM2 and/or the classifier over every finished run directory
repgenr genome-qc --assemblies asm -o qc --checkm2-db $CHECKM2DB \
    --gtdb-sketch gtdb-rs226-reps.k31-sc10k.sig.zip --gtdb-lineages lineages.csv \
    --classifier auto -t 16
# the genome contract: genomes/, selection.tsv, assembly_stats.tsv, excused_runs.tsv
repgenr reads-gather --reads-tsv $WD/reads.tsv --assemblies asm --qc qc -o out \
    --min-completeness 50 --max-contamination 10
```

`assemble-run` writes `contigs.fasta` and the `assembly.ok` marker into its
`--out` directory, or `excused_runs.tsv` when the run has no FASTQ mirror, an
unsupported platform, or fails to download, assemble or polish (`--polisher`,
`--polish-rounds`, `--keep-reads`, `--keep-files` and `--tool-arg` as on
`assemble`). `genome-qc` reads a
directory of such run directories (`--assemblies`) and writes `quality.tsv`
and `classification.tsv` keyed by run accession; it needs at least one
database. `reads-gather` applies the quality gate and the naming policy above
from the optional `--qc` directory and writes an empty
`outgroup_accession.txt`, since the reads chain has no outgroup at this
point. None of the steps touches a working directory or the manifest.

### Viruses

The viral path selects from NCBI Virus by default (via the `datasets` CLI);
`vmetadata --source bvbrc` uses the legacy BV-BRC FTP path instead.

```bash
WD=./hav
repgenr vmetadata -wd $WD --target hepatovirus            # NCBI Virus (default)
repgenr vgenome   -wd $WD --target-genus Hepatovirus      # add --group-segments for segmented viruses
repgenr dereplicate -wd $WD --tool skder
repgenr phylo -wd $WD --treebuilder mashtree
repgenr tree2tax -wd $WD --include-dereplicated
# or: repgenr run -wd $WD --viral --target hepatovirus -tg Hepatovirus --treebuilder mashtree
```

`--virus` passes virus-tuned settings to dRep (`--tool drep --virus`); the
other dereplicators do not read it, and `dereplicate` warns when it is given
with one of them.

`vgenome` picks an outgroup by itself: a record of a sister species with
enough genomes, chosen by distance (mashtree by default). `--outgroup-accession`
pins it to a downloaded record instead, an accession on the NCBI Virus path
or a record id on BV-BRC, and `run --viral --outgroup-accession` forwards
the same choice. With `--group-segments` the search still runs, with the
kept records' length span widened by 15 percent as its window, and the
outgroup is one record of the sister species rather than a grouped isolate.
`--no-outgroup` leaves the tree unrooted, and a run that ends without an
outgroup removes the outgroup an earlier run left in `outgroup/` and
`outgroup_accession.txt`.

On the NCBI Virus path the species of a record is the current species of
its taxid in NCBI Taxonomy. After the download, `vmetadata` looks up every
distinct taxid once with `datasets summary taxonomy taxon` and stores the
species, genus and family in `virus_records.json`, so `vgenome` needs no
network. NCBI organism names are often strain-level or earlier names
(`Sabia virus` in `Mammarenavirus brazilense`, `Hantaan virus CGAa1011` in
`Orthohantavirus hantanense`), and one species can carry several of them
(Junin, taxid 2169991, as `Argentinian mammarenavirus` and `Mammarenavirus
juninense`). The lineage in the NCBI Virus report is not a reliable
substitute: it nests species that NCBI Taxonomy keeps as siblings (Maguari
virus under `Orthobunyavirus cacheense` > `Orthobunyavirus maguariense`,
while its species is `Orthobunyavirus maguariense`), and it can lack the
current species altogether (Murutucu virus, species `Orthobunyavirus
maritubaense`).

When the lookup fails, or gives no species for a taxid, the species comes
from the report lineage, and the log says so: the shallowest lineage name
made of a genus (or the genus above a subgenus) and one lower-case epithet,
such as `Mammarenavirus brazilense`. Earlier names below it that start with
the genus (`Hepatovirus A` under `Hepatovirus ahepa`) are not taken, and all
records of a taxid take the binomial found on most of them. A record without
either keeps its organism name as the species. Each record's
`species_source` (`taxonomy`, `lineage` or `organism`) says which rule
applied, and the `vmetadata` record counts them. Organism names of the form
`<Genus> sp.` (`Orthohantavirus sp.`) are a species in NCBI Taxonomy, so
the unclassified records filed under one such name share one species token.

The species sets the species token of the canonical filename, the
`--target-species` match, the per-species medians of the length window and
the grouping of outgroup candidates, so strains of the target species are
not taken as sister species. A `--target-species` value also selects the
species of every record whose organism name it is (`-ts "Argentinian
mammarenavirus"` selects all of `Mammarenavirus juninense`), together with
any species token it matches, and the log says so. The organism name stays
in the `description` column of `virus_metadata_base.tsv` and in
`--target-serotype` matching.

`--group-segments` groups records that share a species and an isolate name and
carry at least two distinct segments. Segment labels are free text in NCBI
Virus and are compared after normalisation: the text after a `;` is dropped,
words that only name the molecule or the word segment (`RNA`, `DNA`,
`segment`, `genome`, `component`, `circular`) are skipped, the first
remaining word is kept in upper case, and small, medium, middle and large become S, M, M and
L. So `M`, `M; medium` and `middle` are one segment, `S RNA` is `S` and
`DNA-A` is `A`, while `RNA 1` and `RNA 2` stay distinct. A label of
`Unknown` counts as no label. Each isolate keeps one record per
segment (complete before partial, then the longest, then the lowest
accession), since NCBI Virus often holds several submissions of one segment;
records without a segment label stay single genomes. A grouped isolate's
genome carries a synthetic `iso-` token as its accession (with its first
member accession appended when two isolate names would give the same token);
`segments.tsv` records the member accessions behind it with the normalised
segment and the label as submitted, and `tree2tax` lists the members under
the isolate's leaf in `genomes_map.tsv`.

A workdir whose `vmetadata` ran before the species came from NCBI Taxonomy
keeps its genomes and filenames while its stages skip. When `vgenome` reruns
on it (new arguments or `--force`), it refuses the old records and asks for
one `repgenr --force vmetadata` with the same arguments; that download
renames the viral genomes, and `vgenome` and the later stages then rerun.

`vmetadata` records the source and target of `virus_download_wd/download.fa`
in `download.source`. The BV-BRC source reuses the group FASTA only for the
same target and downloads it again otherwise; switching a workdir between the
two sources removes the other source's tables, so `vgenome` reads the latest
download. A BV-BRC workdir written by an earlier version has no
`download.source`, so its first re-run downloads the group FASTA again.

### Viral length filtering and over-represented species

The viral selection step keeps records whose genome length falls inside a
window around a center value. The default center, `--length-method
median_of_medians`, is a deliberate defense against over-sequenced species:
the median length is computed per species first, and the window center is the
median of those per-species medians, so a species with 900 outbreak records
carries exactly one vote. Switching to `--length-method mean` averages every
record and lets the most-sequenced species set the window -- use it only when
the selection is known to be balanced. `--length-range` overrides the window
entirely and `--length-all` disables the filter.

### Alignment-free and SNP-based phylogenies

`phylo` and `phylo-build` need at least three ingroup genomes (the outgroup is not
counted) and exit 3 with a message before any tool runs when the set is smaller.
After the tree is built, its leaves are compared with the input genomes
(ingroup and outgroup). A tree builder can drop a genome it considers
degenerate and still exit 0, as mashtree does; a missing or unexpected leaf
then exits 3 with the names and the builder. The tree is kept in `tree/` for
inspection, and `phylo` is not recorded as completed. Leaf names are compared
without a FASTA extension or ParSNP's `.ref` reference marker, and with
characters other than letters, digits, `_` and `-` read as `_`, since some
tools rewrite them. This matching is looser than `tree2tax`, which uses leaf
names as written, so a tree that passes the check can still leave leaves that
`tree2tax` does not map to a genome.

`tree2tax` and `tree2tax-relations` root the tree on the outgroup and exit 3
when the outgroup is not a leaf of the tree. After `phylo --no-outgroup`,
`tree2tax` leaves the tree unrooted; `tree2tax-relations` does so when given
`--no-outgroup`, which ignores `--outgroup-dir` and `--outgroup-accession`.
The Nextflow pipeline passes `--no-outgroup` to `tree2tax-relations` when
`phylo_args` contains it.

Two alternatives to the whole-genome alignment in the bacterial example (see
[choosing-tools.md](choosing-tools.md#5-phylogeny-routes) for when to use which):

```bash
# Scalable dereplication then an alignment-free tree
repgenr dereplicate -wd $WD --tool skder
repgenr phylo -wd $WD --treebuilder mashtree

# SNP-based phylogeny (core-SNP alignment as the MSA source)
repgenr snptype -wd $WD --tool simple
repgenr phylo -wd $WD --msa-source snptype --treebuilder iqtree --mask gubbins
```

### Resume and `--force`

Each stage records its parameters, the digests of its inputs, and the container
identity in `repgenr.yaml`; re-running a stage is a safe no-op only when all
three are unchanged (it logs that it skipped). Re-running an upstream stage
(e.g. `repgenr --force dereplicate ...`) changes a downstream stage's input
digests, so the downstream stage re-runs automatically the next time it is
invoked. Change a
parameter, switch `--container`, or pass `--force` to re-run explicitly.
`--force` is a global option and goes before the command name
(`repgenr --force dereplicate -wd WD`); after the command name it is rejected
as an unknown option. A stage writes its record without a completion stamp before it starts, so one
that failed or crashed mid-run is listed as `[interrupted]` by `status`,
reported as a failure by `doctor`, and always re-runs; a successful run
stamps the record. A failure in parameter validation writes no record. A
stage that refuses (exit 2 or 3, or 4 for a tool missing at its preflight)
without changing any of its main outputs leaves the record as it was: none
on a first run, and the last finished one on a re-run, since its outputs are
untouched. Examples are `phylo` with fewer than three genomes and
`snptype --mask gubbins` without Gubbins. A failed external tool (exit 6),
or a refusal after a main output changed, leaves the record interrupted.
Before skipping, a stage also checks that its main outputs exist (for example
`genomes/` and `manifest.sqlite` for `ingest`, `derep/clusters.tsv` and
`derep/representatives/` for `dereplicate`, `tree/tree.nwk` for `phylo`,
`tree2tax.tsv` and `genomes_map.tsv` for `tree2tax`; a directory must not be
empty, and dotfiles such as `.DS_Store` or exFAT `._` files do not count;
`genomes/` and `derep/representatives/` count only with a genome FASTA file
in them, so one holding only a leftover `x.fasta.tmp` is treated as empty).
Each genome listed in `selection.tsv` is checked for the stage that wrote
the genome set (`genome`, `ingest`, `vgenome`, `assemble`), and each
representative listed in `derep/clusters.tsv` for `dereplicate`. If one was
deleted, the stage logs
`Stage 'X': deliverable <path> missing; re-running.` and runs again, so
`--force` is not needed to rebuild it; a genome deleted from `genomes/` is
restored by the next run of that stage. To drop a genome on purpose, remove
it from the source directory or from the `--selection` file and re-run the
entry stage. For `glance` only
`glance_clustering_dendrogram.pdf` is checked, since its plots are absent
when no value falls within the plot bounds. `repgenr
doctor -wd <wd>` verifies a workdir's outputs against its records (missing,
corrupt or untracked genomes, manifest drift, truncated deliverables,
interrupted stages). It exits 7 on failures and 0 when it finds only
warnings; a missing deliverable or a changed input is a warning under the
same path, since the stage will re-run. `doctor --quick` skips reading the
first bytes of each genome file, the slowest check on a large genome set
(about 30 s per 1000 files on an exFAT disk); links, missing and untracked
genomes are still checked, and the genome line says the content was not
read, so a non-FASTA file saved under a FASTA name goes unnoticed. Both
commands accept `--json` and then print one versioned JSON object on stdout
instead of the text report, for scripts and workflow wrappers; the exit
codes are unchanged, and on exit 3 stdout stays empty. The schemas are in
[output.md](output.md#machine-readable-status). `status` reads the same tables and
lists such a stage as `[stale]`, so the two commands agree on what re-runs.
A malformed `repgenr.yaml` is reported by both: `doctor` as a failure,
`status` and every stage with exit 3.

Input directories (`genomes/`, `derep/representatives/`, `outgroup/`, the
`ingest --genomes-dir` source) are digested from the genome FASTA files in
them, the files the stages read (names ending in `.fasta`, `.fa`, `.fna`,
`.fas`, `.fasta.gz`, `.fna.gz` or `.fa.gz`). A leftover `x.fasta.tmp`, a
`.fai` index, a `truth.json` or a README beside the genomes therefore does
not re-run the stages that read the directory. A workdir recorded by an
earlier version re-runs a stage once only when such a file was present
(for example `ingest` from a source directory that holds a `truth.json`);
`derep-stock --action unpack` repeats once, since its stored run is now
digested file by file.

Two limitations, both covered by `--force`: input directories are digested from
file metadata (name, size, mtime), so an in-place edit that preserves size and
mtime is not detected; and upgrading a natively installed tool binary does not
invalidate previous results (switching the container backend or platform does).
Workdirs created by older RepGenR versions re-run each stage once (the
fingerprint format changed).

### Representative selection

`repgenr dereplicate` and `repgenr run` accept `--keeper quality|tool` (default
`quality`), and so do the Nextflow steps `dereplicate-chunk` and
`dereplicate-merge` (`--derep_keeper`). After the chosen dereplicator clusters
the genomes, the keeper step re-picks each cluster's representative by
assembly quality (`src/repgenr/stages/derep_keeper.py`), which corrects the tendency of connectivity-based tools to keep the
most-sequenced (not the best-quality) genome in a cluster. The values come
from the manifest: GTDB selections carry CheckM values (`--source api` fetches
them from each genome's card, one request per selected genome), `assemble
--checkm2-db` scores assemblies, and `ingest --selection` reads the
`completeness` and `contamination` columns. The Nextflow steps read the same
columns from `selection.tsv`. `--keeper tool` restores the adapter's own pick.
When no genome under `genomes/` has quality the stage warns, and
`repgenr.yaml` records `keeper_effective: tool` next to the requested `keeper`
and the swap count.

The score follows dRep's default weights for the terms that need no further
tool: `completeness - 5 x contamination + 0.5 x log10(N50)`, with the N50
read once per genome from its FASTA (gzipped or not). The N50 term separates
genomes whose CheckM values differ by less than CheckM's precision: on 30
GTDB *F. tularensis* genomes, all scored between 99.44 and 100, a 29-contig
draft at 100/0.00 outscored closed genomes at 100/0.03 on CheckM alone, but
not with the N50 term. Genomes are compared in this order:

1. higher score;
2. higher completeness;
3. lower contamination;
4. higher N50;
5. genome filename, in sort order.

Only genomes with completeness and contamination compete; a genome without
them never becomes the representative. When the adapter's representative has
values, the best genome in the cluster wins, that representative included, so
the result does not depend on which genome the tool picked. When it has none,
a scored genome replaces it only if it is high quality by the MIMAG
thresholds (completeness above 90, contamination below 5). A scored fragment
therefore does not displace an unscored complete genome; the log names the
clusters left with the tool's representative for this reason. A cluster
without any scored genome keeps the adapter's choice.

The workdir stage applies the keeper once, to the final clusters of a chunked
run. The Nextflow steps apply it within each chunk and again after the merge,
so the merge pass compares the chunk keepers rather than the tools' picks.
Both end with the keeper of each final cluster, but the clusters themselves
can differ slightly, since the merge pass compares different genomes. Each
chunk records the N50 of its scored genomes in `genome_n50.tsv`, so the merge
step scores members whose files it does not receive.

The keeper rule changed in this release (N50 term, high-quality condition,
tie order). Existing workdirs keep their representatives until dereplicate is
rerun with `--force`, since the resume fingerprint does not include the rule.

`--keeper gtdb` keeps the GTDB species representatives. The metadata stage
records which selected genomes GTDB marks as the representative of their
species (`gtdb_genome_representative` equal to the accession in the table,
`gtdbIsRep` in the API), in the `gtdb_representative` column of
`selection.tsv` and in the manifest. Within each cluster the keeper is then a
GTDB representative when the cluster holds one; a cluster without one is
treated as under `--keeper quality`, and keeps the tool's pick when no member
is scored. A cluster can hold several GTDB representatives when the ANI
threshold joins GTDB species (GTDB delimits species at about 95% ANI, so a
`--secondary-ani` below that can do so). One representative per cluster is
kept, chosen among them by the quality rule (score, tie order and the
high-quality condition for an unscored representative as above), and a
warning names the others, which stay contained; raise `--secondary-ani` to
keep them apart. With `--reduce`, a
GTDB representative is also preferred when representatives of one taxon are
merged. `repgenr.yaml` records `keeper_effective: gtdb` when the manifest
flags at least one genome, and otherwise `quality` or `tool` with a warning.
Only GTDB selections carry the flag: `ingest` (unless its `--selection` has
the column), `reads`/`assemble` and the viral path leave it at 0, so
`--keeper gtdb` acts there as `--keeper quality`. A workdir selected by an
earlier RepGenR has no flag recorded; `repgenr metadata --force` with the same
options records it. `genome` then runs again because `selection.tsv`
changed, and downloads nothing already present; `dereplicate` runs again
because the manifest now flags genomes. A manifest from an earlier version is
upgraded in place (schema version 3) when a stage opens it, and an earlier
RepGenR then refuses to open it.

The same manifest values also reach the dereplicator, whichever keeper rule is
chosen (the Nextflow chunk and merge steps read them from `selection.tsv`),
when every genome of the run has both values. dRep receives them as
`--genomeInfo` and then runs without CheckM; galah receives them as
`--genome-info` and ranks genomes by quality. The decision is taken once for
the run, so every chunk and the merge pass use the same source. When some
genomes lack values, none are passed and a warning names them: dRep runs
CheckM, and galah, which otherwise keeps the first listed genome of a cluster,
receives the genomes by descending file size, so a complete genome rather than
a fragment becomes the representative.

`--tool sourmash` keeps its signatures in a sketch cache. `--target-reps`
shares one cache across its search steps; `--tool-arg sketch_cache=DIR` sets a
directory that persists across runs. With the branchwater plugin, cache
entries are matched by genome file name, size and modification time; without
it, a per-genome signature is reused when it is not older than the genome
file. A genome replaced under the same name is therefore sketched again,
except when the new file carries an older timestamp (copied with `cp -p` or
`rsync -t`) or, with the plugin, the same size and timestamp. Empty the
directory after such a replacement.

`--reduce species|genus` collapses the ANI representatives to one per taxon
after dereplication. The representative of the largest cluster is the
default keeper of a taxon; with `--keeper quality` and scores known, the
keeper rule above re-picks among the taxon's representatives; `--target-reps N` searches the secondary ANI to
land near N representatives. Both exist on `dereplicate` and, since the
merge step is where the final set is decided, on `dereplicate-merge`, which
the Nextflow layer drives through `--derep_reduce` and `--derep_target_reps`.
The merge step takes the taxonomy from `selection.tsv` when one reaches it
and from the canonical genome filenames otherwise.

### Inspecting a dereplication

Three commands read a dereplicated working directory without rerunning the
dereplicator, and a fourth inspects the genomes before dereplication.
`repgenr cluster-summary` regenerates
`derep/cluster_summary.tsv`, one row per representative (see `output.md`).
`repgenr derep-unpack` lays the clusters out as one directory per
representative with its members inside (`--no-representant` leaves the
representative out); a member missing from `genomes/` is left out with a
warning that names it. The files are hard links to the genomes where the
file system allows it, so editing one in place also changes the genome under
`genomes/` (and, after a default symlinking `ingest`, the original file);
elsewhere, for example on exFAT or across volumes, they are copies, which for
1000 genomes took minutes rather than under a second. The directories
describe the dereplication they were made from: after a new `dereplicate` or
a `derep-stock --action unpack`, run `derep-unpack` again (it reruns because
`clusters.tsv` changed, and `doctor` warns until then). `repgenr glance` compares all genomes
in `genomes/` (at least two) with dRep or sourmash and writes a dendrogram
and two plots; it does not need a dereplication. `repgenr derep-stock
--action pack --name <run>` stores the current clusters, statuses,
representatives and the completed `dereplicate` record (tool, parameters,
tool versions, as `record.json`) under `derep/stock/<run>`; a run already stored under that
name is replaced, with a warning. `--action unpack` restores a stored run,
refreshes the manifest and re-stamps the `dereplicate` record so that the
next `dereplicate`, also inside `repgenr run`, recomputes. Unpack rebuilds
`cluster_summary.tsv` from the restored clusters and the current manifest
quality, and removes a live `genome_status.tsv` the stored run lacks. The N50
of a scored genome whose file is no longer in `genomes/` cannot be read, so
its keeper score in the summary has no N50 term and `rep_n50` is blank; unpack
and `cluster-summary` name such genomes in a warning. Unpack replaces
`derep/representatives/` as a whole, so other files placed there are
removed, and it takes the representatives by name from `genomes/`. The
re-stamped record takes the tool, parameters and tool versions from the
stored `record.json` and adds `stock: <run>`, so `status` and `versions`
name the tool that produced the stored run; its completion time is that of
the unpack. A run stored without
`record.json` (packed before this file was written, or packed while no
completed `dereplicate` record existed, which pack reports with a warning)
keeps the tool and parameters of the
`dereplicate` record current at unpack time instead. In that case a record
left incomplete by an interrupted `dereplicate` run carries nothing over (no
tool), and one left by an interrupted unpack keeps what that unpack was
carrying. `--action
list` prints the stored run names on stdout, one per line in name order, and
`--action delete` removes one. Deleting a run that is not stored exits 3 and
lists the stored runs.

#### Which command answers which question

| Question | Where to look |
|----------|---------------|
| How many clusters, and how large is each? | `derep/cluster_summary.tsv` (`repgenr cluster-summary` rebuilds it); `n_members` does not count the representative. |
| Which genomes are in the cluster of representative X? | Rows of `derep/clusters.tsv` whose first column is X, or the directory `derep/unpacked/<X without its extension>/` after `repgenr derep-unpack`. |
| What happened to one genome? | `derep/genome_status.tsv`: `representative`, `contained` or `fail_qc`. |
| Do the genomes fall into clear groups before I pick thresholds? | `repgenr glance`, see below. |
| How do two dereplications differ? | Store each with `derep-stock --action pack`, then compare the stored files, see below. |

The commands read `derep/clusters.tsv` and the manifest. They do not check
that the last `dereplicate` finished, so run `repgenr status -wd WD` first: a
failed or refused `dereplicate` shows as `[interrupted]` while `derep/` still
holds the previous result.

#### Finding the members of a cluster

`clusters.tsv` has one row per genome, with the representative in the first
column and the member in the second. The representative also lists itself.

```bash
# members of the third-largest cluster (summary rows are sorted by size)
REP=$(sed -n 4p $WD/derep/cluster_summary.tsv | cut -f1)
awk -F'\t' -v r="$REP" '$1 == r {print $2}' $WD/derep/clusters.tsv
```

`derep-unpack` gives the same grouping as directories of links, which is
convenient for a tool that takes a directory. The directory name is the
representative's filename without its extension.

#### Reading `glance`

`glance` does not need a dereplication and sets no thresholds. `--tool`
chooses the comparison tool:

- `auto` (the default) uses dRep when it can run, on the `PATH` or through
  the container backend, and sourmash otherwise. The log names the tool it
  picked, and the stage record holds that tool, not `auto`. With neither
  available, glance exits 4 and names the tools that can compare.
- `drep` runs `dRep compare` (Mash, primary clustering only) and plots Mash
  ANI. The dendrogram is dRep's own.
- `sourmash` sketches the genomes with the parameters `dereplicate --tool
  sourmash` uses (k=31, scaled=1000), runs `sourmash compare`, and converts
  the values to the same ANI estimate the dereplication threshold applies
  to. The dendrogram is average-linkage clustering on 1 - ANI. The full N x N
  matrix is held in memory, so sets above 5000 genomes are refused.

The plot axes name the measure, Mash ANI or ANI; the file names stay the
same for both tools. The two estimates differ slightly, so compare plots made
with the same tool. The histogram shows how the pairwise values are
spread: when they fall into separate groups with an empty gap between them,
a threshold placed in the gap separates them. On the synthetic set
`clonal_50_clustered` (three groups of 20, 15 and 15 genomes) the
between-group values lie at about 0.95 to 0.96, the within-group values at
0.995 or higher, and nothing lies between 0.96 and 0.995 (Mash ANI from dRep
and the sourmash ANI estimate agree on this). If the values are
spread evenly across the range, the threshold decides the cluster sizes, so
check `cluster_summary.tsv` afterwards. With `--tool sourmash` and
`--keep-files`, `glance_wd/pairwise_ani.csv` holds the value of every pair
and `glance_wd/dendrogram_leaves.txt` the dendrogram's leaf order. dRep writes
into its cache with names beginning `._` on exFAT volumes and fails there; use
an APFS or ext4 working directory (see `verification.md`).

#### Comparing two dereplications

Pack each result under its own name, then compare the stored files. Check
with `status` that `dereplicate` finished before each pack; each stored run's
`record.json` then names the tool and parameters that produced it.

```bash
repgenr dereplicate -wd $WD --tool sourmash
repgenr derep-stock -wd $WD --action pack --name sourmash
repgenr dereplicate -wd $WD --tool galah
repgenr derep-stock -wd $WD --action pack --name galah
for n in sourmash galah; do
  echo "$n: $(tail -n +2 $WD/derep/stock/$n/clusters.tsv | cut -f1 | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $1}' | tr '\n' ' ')"
done
diff <(ls $WD/derep/stock/sourmash/representatives) <(ls $WD/derep/stock/galah/representatives)
```

Compare the cluster sizes first, then the memberships. Two dereplicators can
cluster the genomes identically and still keep different genomes as
representatives (see the dereplicator table in `choosing-tools.md`), so a
different representative list alone does not mean a different partition. To
compare partitions, label every genome with the smallest member name of its
cluster and diff the labels:

```bash
part() { awk -F'\t' 'NR==FNR { if (NR>1 && (!($1 in m) || $2<m[$1])) m[$1]=$2; next }
                     FNR>1 { print $2 "\t" m[$1] }' "$1" "$1" | sort; }
diff <(part $WD/derep/stock/sourmash/clusters.tsv) \
     <(part $WD/derep/stock/galah/clusters.tsv) && echo "same partition"
```

`derep-stock --action unpack --name <run>` makes a stored run the current one
again. The restored `dereplicate` record holds no resume fingerprint, since
unpack cannot reproduce the conditions of the original run, so a later
`dereplicate` or `repgenr run` recomputes the dereplication; run `phylo`
directly to build on the restored set. `status` and `doctor` note such a
record.

### Limiting the selection

`repgenr metadata --limit N` caps the bacterial selection at N genomes. The
cap is not the first N rows of the GTDB table: candidates are grouped by
species and taken round-robin, the best-quality genome of every species first,
then each species' next best, until N. Within a species genomes rank by the
CheckM part of the keeper score (completeness minus five times
contamination): the ranking happens before download, so no N50 exists yet.
Unscored genomes come last, and ties go to the GTDB species-representative
flag, then the accession, so the result is deterministic. A heavily sequenced species
therefore cannot fill the cap on its own. With `-d rep` there is one genome
per species and the rule reduces to a quality ranking across species. On the
`--source api` path the per-genome quality cards are fetched for every
candidate before the cut, one request per genome, four at a time (about five
genomes a second; the 1540 Wolbachia genomes take some five minutes). The
API refuses sustained bursts now and then; refused cards are retried once
more, slowly, and only a genome refused twice is left unscored. The outgroup is chosen
afterwards from the parent taxon, outside the target taxon (a target genome
the cap left out is not a candidate), and never counts against the limit.

### Reusing an alignment across tree builders

`phylo` stamps the alignment it builds (`align/msa_source.json` or
`tree/msa/msa_source.json`) with what produced it: the source and its settings, the
genome set, and the alignment's own digest. A later `phylo` run that changes
only the tree builder, the bootstrap or the thread count reuses that alignment
instead of aligning or SNP-calling again, and says so in the log. Anything the
alignment depends on, such as the aligner, the SNP typer, `--reference`,
`--mask` or the genome set, rebuilds it, as does `--force` or a change to the
alignment file itself.

The same split is available to the stateless step: `phylo-build --msa-only`
builds the alignment and writes `msa.fasta` without a tree, and `phylo-build
--msa <file>` builds a tree from an alignment an earlier call produced. The
Nextflow layer uses these to run the alignment and the tree as separate tasks.
`--msa-only` leaves the SNP typing pass's `tree/msa/` directory (and
`scratch/`) in the step's output directory beside `msa.fasta`; they are left
in place.

### SNP typing and masking

The `repgenr snptype` command (and `phylo-build --msa-source snptype`) call a
SNP typer to produce a core-SNP alignment. Four typers are built in: `simple`
(minimap2, samtools and bcftools, the default), `snippy`, `parsnp` and `ska2`;
the first three map every genome to one reference and also write the
whole-genome alignment a masker needs. Recombination masking (`--mask
gubbins`) runs on the typer's whole-genome alignment and replaces the
core-SNP alignment with Gubbins' filtered polymorphic sites. Typers that only
emit variable sites cannot be masked.

Branch lengths from a variable-site-only alignment (`snp/core_snp.fasta`, or
`tree/msa/core_snp.fasta` from the typing pass of `phylo`) are
inflated, because the alignment carries no ascertainment-bias correction.
Compare topologies and supports rather than lengths, or build the tree from the
whole-genome alignment (`snp/full_alignment.fasta`, written by `simple`,
`snippy` and `parsnp`, not by `ska2`) where branch lengths matter (for example `phylo-build --msa
snp/full_alignment.fasta`).

Gubbins expects isolates of one species. The masker estimates how much of the
alignment is variable, warns above 10%, and repeats the figure if Gubbins
fails: on a genus-level set its scan can die with a bus error (see
`verification.md`).

Gubbins builds a tree in every iteration, by default with RAxML, and with more
than one thread it needs a multi-threaded RAxML build (`raxmlHPC-PTHREADS*`).
Some conda builds ship only the single-threaded binary, and Gubbins then exits
before its first iteration. When repgenr runs Gubbins natively and finds no
such build it switches to IQ-TREE (or to one thread when IQ-TREE is missing
too) and says so in the log. `--tool-arg gubbins_tree_builder=raxmlng`,
`--tool-arg gubbins_first_tree_builder=rapidnj` and
`--tool-arg gubbins_args="--min-snps 5"` pass the choice, the first-iteration
builder and any further `run_gubbins.py` arguments through. Gubbins
leaves taxa with more than 25% gaps or N (`--filter-percentage`) out of its
recombination analysis but still writes them to its outputs, unmasked. Since
the `simple` typer writes N where a genome does not align, repgenr passes
`--filter-percentage 100`. A value given in `gubbins_args` takes precedence;
a taxon above it is then refused (exit 3) before Gubbins runs, with its name.

The `simple` typer maps each genome independently, so `--threads` buys
concurrent genomes first and threads inside one genome's chain only when there
are more threads than genomes. Its per-genome intermediates are written
compressed and removed as soon as that genome's consensus has been read, so
scratch stays at a few hundred megabytes whatever the genome count. A genome
whose chain fails keeps its intermediates for inspection. Under a container
backend each genome's chain of tools runs in a single container, so a genome
costs one engine start rather than eight.

The `simple` typer builds each genome's consensus by applying its SNP calls to
the reference, and then sets to N every reference position where none of the
genome's primary or supplementary alignments places a base: positions outside
the alignments, and positions within a deletion (CIGAR D or N operations), as
read from the minimap2 SAM. Sequence a genome lacks is therefore missing data,
not the reference base. A column of the core-SNP alignment (`snp/core_snp.fasta`,
or `tree/msa/core_snp.fasta` from the typing pass of `phylo`) is kept only when
at least two of A, C, G and T occur in it; N, other ambiguity codes and gaps do
not make a column variable, and they are written as N. The distance matrix
(`snp_distance_matrix.tsv` beside it) counts, for each pair, the differing
sites among those where both genomes have a base, so two genomes are not
separated by a region one of them lacks; a pair that shares no such site has the distance
`NA`. On the 50-genome test set a copy of one genome with 500 kb removed now
differs from that genome at 0 sites; before masking it differed at 20539, all
but one of them within the removed region. Distances between genomes of
different gene content are computed over different numbers of sites, so they
are not directly comparable as proportions.

The log has one line per genome with the fraction of the reference's bases
that genome covers, and a summary line (minimum, median, maximum). A genome
below 50% is warned about. A genome with no base at any core SNP site, usually
one that did not align to the reference at all, is refused (exit 3), since
tree builders refuse a sequence of N only; the message names it.

The `simple` typer maps assemblies with the minimap2 preset `asm20`, which
suits assembly-to-reference alignment up to several percent divergence. Three
genomes of the 50-genome test set have equal length (2 Mb), so their true
substitution counts are position-wise differences. With `asm20` the typer's
distances were within one site of those counts; with minimap2's default
settings, used before, they differed by 8 to 111 sites. A genome more divergent
than `asm20` tolerates, such as an outgroup from another species, aligns over
less of the reference and is correspondingly more N; check the coverage lines
in the log. `--tool-arg preset=` accepts `asm5`, `asm10`, `asm20`, `map-ont`,
`map-pb`, `map-hifi`, `sr` and `none` (minimap2's default settings, no `-x`),
and refuses any other value (exit 2). `asm5` suits near-identical genomes, and
`none` aligns more divergent sequence at the cost of the accuracy above.

Records in every alignment (the SNP typers' and the aligners'
`align/msa.fasta`), the leaves of every tree including the sourmash tree, and
the outgroup name given to the masker are the genome file name without its
FASTA suffix and `.gz` (`x.fasta.gz` gives `x`), as `clusters.tsv` and
tree2tax name genomes.

`parsnp` names its records by file name and marks the reference with `.ref`;
the typer renames them to the genome names, as the other typers write them.

`--tool ska2` (split k-mer analysis) is reference-free: every genome is an
ordinary sample, so no assembly's private errors bias the SNP distances, and
the alphabetical-first-genome reference default does not apply. It emits a
variable-site alignment only, so it is not compatible with `--mask`. Tune with
`--tool-arg ksize=31` and `--tool-arg min_freq=0.9` (the fraction of samples a
split k-mer must occur in). On the 60 Wolbachia species representatives from
GTDB, a genus-level set, it returned 708 variable sites in about two minutes;
it is designed for clonal and outbreak sets, where the shared k-mer space is
far larger.

### Collapsing weak splits in tree2tax

`repgenr tree2tax` (and the `tree2tax-relations` step the Nextflow module
runs) can merge weakly supported or near-zero-length internal nodes into
their parents before naming them, so a split the data does not support does
not become its own FlexTaxD node. Both thresholds are off by default.
`--collapse-length L` merges a node whose branch is shorter than L, in the
tree's own units (mash distance for mashtree, one minus the Jaccard similarity
of the k-mer sketches for the sourmash builder, substitutions per site for the
ML builders). `--collapse-support S` merges a node whose support is below the
fraction S; IQ-TREE and RAxML-NG write percentages and are normalised
automatically, FastTree writes fractions, and mashtree and the sourmash
builder write no supports, in which case the option warns and does nothing.
Either criterion suffices. The root, the outgroup/ingroup split under it and
the leaves never collapse. A collapsed node's branch length is added to its
children's. Provenance records both thresholds and the number of nodes
collapsed, so changing a threshold re-runs the stage. On the 171-leaf
Wolbachia mashtree tree, `--collapse-length 0.0005` removes 26 of 168 internal
nodes.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `--outdir` | `results` | Published results and execution reports. |
| `--mode` | `bacterial` | `bacterial` (GTDB), `viral` (NCBI Virus; BV-BRC via `--vmetadata_args "--source bvbrc"`) or `reads` (ENA/SRA sequencing runs, assembled per run). |
| `--metadata_args` | see config | Arguments for the bacterial metadata stage. |
| `--vmetadata_args` / `--vgenome_args` | see config | Viral metadata / genome selection arguments. |
| `--reads_args` | see config | Arguments for the reads stage (ENA/SRA run selection by taxon or accession). |
| `--assembler` | `auto` | Assembler for every run in reads mode (`auto` picks by platform). |
| `--assemble_args` | (empty) | Extra `assemble-run` flags in reads mode (`--polisher`, `--min-contig-length`, `--tool-arg`). |
| `--checkm2_db` | `null` | CheckM2 database; switches on quality scoring and the completeness/contamination gate in reads mode. |
| `--gtdb_sketch` / `--gtdb_lineages` | `null` | GTDB sourmash sketch and its lineages CSV; switch on classification and GTDB naming in reads mode. |
| `--derep_tool` | `skder` | Dereplicator for the scatter-gather step. |
| `--derep_process_size` | `null` | Genomes per dereplication chunk (single chunk if unset). |
| `--derep_primary_ani` / `--derep_secondary_ani` / `--derep_aligned_fraction` | `0.90` / `0.99` / `0.50` | ANI / aligned-fraction thresholds. |
| `--derep_keeper` | `quality` | Representative choice in the chunk and merge steps: `quality` (CheckM scores from `selection.tsv`), `gtdb` (a GTDB species representative from `selection.tsv` first, then quality) or `tool`. |
| `--derep_reduce` | `none` | Collapse the merged representatives to one per `species` or `genus` (`dereplicate-merge --reduce`). |
| `--derep_target_reps` | `0` | Search the merge pass's secondary ANI to land near this many representatives (`dereplicate-merge --target-reps`). |
| `--phylo_args` | `--treebuilder mashtree` | Aligner or tree builder for the phylogeny. |
| `--phylo_split_msa` | `false` | Run the alignment and the tree as separate tasks. |
| `--tree2tax_args` | (empty) | tree-to-taxonomy (FlexTaxD) arguments; redundant genomes are listed by default (`--no-include-dereplicated` to omit them). `--no-outgroup` is added when `phylo_args` contains it. |

`--phylo_split_msa` splits the phylogeny into `PHYLO_MSA` and `PHYLO_TREE`.
The alignment then keeps its own cache entry, so trying another tree builder or
another bootstrap re-runs only the tree, and the two halves take their own
resource labels: the alignment is `process_high`, the tree `process_medium`.
It applies to tree builders that consume an alignment; leave it off for
mashtree or sourmash, which build from genomes.

Parameters are validated against `nextflow/nextflow_schema.json` at launch.

#### Passing parameters

Either pass them on the command line (`--name value`) or, for a reusable and
typed configuration, supply a params file:

```bash
nextflow run nextflow/main.nf -profile standard -params-file params.json
```

A starting point is in `nextflow/assets/params_example.json`. On the command line, give a string parameter whose value starts with a dash
as `--key=value` (for example `--tree2tax_args=--include-dereplicated`):
Nextflow reads `--key --flag` as the boolean `key = true`. A params file keeps
numeric values typed (e.g. `"derep_process_size": 2000`); on the command line
they arrive as strings, which the schema also accepts for the numeric options.

### Profiles

The `standard` profile (the default, local executor) caps every process's
CPU and memory request to what the machine has; `base.config` asks for up to
32 CPUs and 128 GB for the heavy processes, which the local executor would
otherwise refuse. `slurm` leaves the requests as they are and sets only the
executor: the queue or account is site-specific, so pass it in a site config
(`-c site.config` with `process.queue = '...'`). The same holds for a cloud
executor such as AWS Batch: the pipeline ships no cloud profile, because the
region, the job queue and an image that provides `repgenr` and the tools are
values only the site knows; a site config that sets them is all that is
needed.

Combine an executor profile with an optional container profile, e.g.
`-profile slurm,singularity`.

- **Executors**: `standard` (local), `slurm`.
- **Containers**: `docker`, `singularity`, `wave`. These set RepGenR's own
  adapter-level container backend (`--container ...`). Under `docker` or
  `singularity` every adapter with a pinned image runs in it (all but the
  `simple` SNP typer, parsnp, skder and SibeliaZ, which run on the host and
  say so in the log); `wave` mints an image from each adapter's conda
  specification instead, which also covers those four. RepGenR itself must
  be available to the Nextflow process.
- **`test`**: minimal resources and a small target for a quick smoke run.

`PHYLO` (and the split `PHYLO_MSA`/`PHYLO_TREE`) publish the alignment they
built (`phylo/align/` for an aligner, `phylo/tree/msa/` for a SNP typer, with
the reuse stamp) and the tree builder's own files under `phylo/tree/`, beside the
tree.

### Scaling

For large dereplication inputs (10k+ genomes), set a chunk size so the
dereplication scatters across tasks (one per chunk):

```bash
nextflow run nextflow/main.nf --outdir results \
    --derep_tool sourmash --derep_process_size 2000 -profile slurm -c site.config
```

Resource labels (`process_low/medium/high`, and `process_assembly` for the
per-run assembly tasks of reads mode, whose memory follows the read platform)
scale memory and time with the retry attempt, so a task killed for memory or
time is resubmitted with more headroom. Tune the label values per environment
in `nextflow/conf/base.config`.

#### Scatter-gather dereplication

For horizontal scaling, the `DEREPLICATE_SCATTER` subworkflow groups genomes into
chunks of `--derep_process_size`, dereplicates each chunk as a separate task (one
per node on HPC), and dereplicates the union of the chunk representatives once
more (the two-stage reduce-tree expressed as typed data channels). It wraps the
`repgenr dereplicate-chunk` / `dereplicate-merge` CLI steps and is driven by
`--derep_tool` and the `--derep_*_ani` / `--derep_aligned_fraction` thresholds.

A standalone harness runs it on a directory of genome FASTAs (no GTDB/NCBI
front-end), useful for testing and for dereplicating a local collection:

```bash
nextflow run nextflow/tests/dereplicate_scatter.nf -c nextflow/nextflow.config \
    --genomes_dir <DIR> --derep_tool sourmash --derep_process_size 2000 \
    --outdir results -profile standard
```

Add `-stub` to exercise the wiring without running the tools.

#### Configuring processes

Each Nextflow process reads its tool flags from `task.ext.args`, which
`nextflow/conf/modules.config` maps from the user-facing parameters:
`--metadata_args`, `--vmetadata_args` and `--vgenome_args`, `--phylo_args`,
`--tree2tax_args`, and five dereplication parameters (`--derep_tool`,
`--derep_primary_ani`, `--derep_secondary_ani`, `--derep_aligned_fraction`,
`--derep_keeper`) composed into one string for the two dereplication
processes; `--derep_process_size` is read by the scatter subworkflow to
size the chunks and is not a tool flag. Publishing directories live in
the same file, and resources and the retry window in
`nextflow/conf/base.config`. A site can retune one process without touching
the pipeline by passing its own config:

```groovy
// site.config
process {
    withName: 'PHYLO' {
        ext.args = '--treebuilder iqtree --bootstrap 1000'
    }
    withName: 'DEREP_CHUNK|DEREP_MERGE' {
        ext.args = '--tool galah --secondary-ani 0.98'
    }
}
```

`nextflow run nextflow/main.nf -c site.config ...`. `ext.repgenr_opts` is
the hook for the top-level repgenr options every process prepends (the
container profiles set it through `--repgenr_opts`).

An `ext.args` override replaces the whole string for that process; for the
dereplication processes that means every flag not repeated in the override
falls back to the repgenr CLI default rather than to the `--derep_*`
parameter.

Every channel carries a meta map built once per run: `id` is a slug of the
selection target (`francisella` for `-tg francisella`), `mode` is
`bacterial` or `viral`. Task tags and the dereplication chunk names use it.

Nextflow resolves both `bin/` and the default config relative to the
launched script. The harness scripts under `nextflow/tests/` therefore reach
the versions helper through the symlink
`nextflow/tests/bin/repgenr_versions_fragment`, and running one of them
directly needs `-c nextflow/nextflow.config` (nf-test supplies the config
itself). Any future script added to `nextflow/bin/` needs its own link under
`nextflow/tests/bin/`.

The pipeline requires Nextflow 26.04 or later (`nextflowVersion =
'!>=26.04.0'`).

#### Pipeline structure

`nextflow/main.nf` dispatches by `--mode` to one of three data-channel
subworkflows that share the dereplication, phylo and tree2tax modules:

```
bacterial: ACQUIRE       (metadata -> genome)          -> DEREPLICATE_SCATTER -> PHYLO -> TREE2TAX
viral:     VACQUIRE      (vmetadata -> vgenome)        -> DEREPLICATE_SCATTER -> PHYLO -> TREE2TAX
reads:     ACQUIRE_READS (reads -> assemble per run
                          -> [genome-qc] -> gather)    -> DEREPLICATE_SCATTER -> PHYLO -> TREE2TAX
```

`metadata` emits a portable `selection.tsv`; `genome-fetch` downloads the genomes
and emits them as a channel feeding the scatter-gather dereplication; `phylo` and
`tree2tax` run in task-local working directories and emit `tree.nwk`,
`tree2tax.tsv` and `genomes_map.tsv` to `--outdir`. Add `-stub` to any run for a
quick wiring check without external tools.

In reads mode `READS_SELECT` runs `repgenr reads` and emits `reads.tsv`; every
row becomes one `READS_ASSEMBLE` task (`assemble-run`, label
`process_assembly`: 8 CPUs, 16 GB for a short-read run and 32 GB for a
long-read one, 6 h, scaled by attempt), so a hundred runs assemble in
parallel on a cluster. When `--checkm2_db` or `--gtdb_sketch` is set, one
`GENOME_QC` task (`genome-qc`, `process_medium`) scores and classifies the
batch; `READS_GATHER` (`reads-gather`) applies the gate and the naming
policy and emits the genome FASTAs, `selection.tsv` and an empty outgroup
accession file, the same tuple `ACQUIRE` emits. `reads.tsv`,
`selection.tsv`, `assembly_stats.tsv`, `excused_runs.tsv` and the QC tables
are published under `reads/`.

```bash
nextflow run nextflow/main.nf --mode reads --outdir results \
    --reads_args "-tg mycoplasmopsis --platform illumina --max-runs 20" \
    --assembler auto --checkm2_db /db/checkm2 \
    --gtdb_sketch /db/gtdb-rs226-reps.k31-sc10k.sig.zip --gtdb_lineages /db/lineages.csv \
    -profile slurm,singularity
```

## Running tools in containers

RepGenR can run each external tool inside a pinned container instead of relying
on tools installed on `PATH`. This unblocks Linux-only tools on any host (e.g.
macOS) and makes tool versions reproducible. RepGenR itself runs on the host;
only the tool subprocess is containerized, so it works in the plain CLI and
inside Nextflow.

### Quick start

```bash
# Run every tool in a container via Docker:
repgenr --container docker dereplicate -wd $WD --tool drep

# Singularity/Apptainer (HPC), with .sif images on a large disk:
repgenr --container singularity --container-cache /Volumes/LaCie/repgenr_sif \
        phylo -wd $WD --aligner progressivemauve --treebuilder iqtree
```

`--container` is a top-level option (place it before the subcommand). Default is
`none` (native execution, unchanged).

### Options (top-level, or env var)

| Option | Env var | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `--container {none,docker,singularity}` | `REPGENR_CONTAINER` | execution backend |
| `--container-engine <bin>` | `REPGENR_CONTAINER_ENGINE` | engine override (apptainer, podman) |
| `--container-cache <dir>` | `REPGENR_CONTAINER_CACHE` | Singularity `.sif` images and cache (can be external) |
| `--platform <plat>` | `REPGENR_CONTAINER_PLATFORM` | e.g. `linux/amd64` to emulate BioContainers on Apple Silicon |
| `--wave / --no-wave` | `REPGENR_WAVE` | resolve multi-tool/arm64 images via the Seqera Wave CLI |
| `--bin-dir TOOL=DIR` (repeatable) | `REPGENR_BIN_DIRS` (`tool=dir,tool=dir`) | put DIR first on `PATH` for one tool on the host (a satellite conda environment); see below |

Image sources, the storage location, Apple Silicon and Rosetta setup, and the
notes on bind mounts and known image problems are in
[install.md](install.md#3-containers).

### Per-tool directories (`--bin-dir`)

`--bin-dir TOOL=DIR` puts DIR first on `PATH` for one tool only: for its
preflight lookup and version query, and for every host subprocess it runs, so
a wrapper such as `run_gubbins.py` calls the helpers of its own environment.
Other tools keep the inherited `PATH`. TOOL is an adapter name as printed by
`repgenr list-tools` (for example `gubbins`, `mashtree`, `snippy`, `parsnp`,
`progressivemauve`), or `checkm2`, `datasets` or `minimap2` (racon's mapper).
The option is repeatable, and `REPGENR_BIN_DIRS="gubbins=/p/bin,mashtree=/q/bin"`
sets the same; an option given on the command line replaces the variable's
entry for that tool. An unknown tool or a directory that does not exist exits
2.

```bash
P=$(conda info --base)/envs
repgenr --bin-dir gubbins=$P/repgenr-gubbins/bin --bin-dir mashtree=$P/repgenr-mashtree/bin \
        phylo -wd $WD --msa-source snptype --snptyper simple --mask gubbins
```

The directory each tool used is recorded under `bin_dirs` in the stage's
record in `repgenr.yaml`. It is not part of the resume fingerprint, so
setting or changing it does not rerun a finished stage; the tool's version is
recorded as before. Under `--container`, a tool that runs in an image is not
affected, and a warning names it. In Nextflow, pass the option through
`params.repgenr_opts`, for example `--repgenr_opts '--bin-dir gubbins=/p/bin'`.
This value replaces the one a container profile sets, so with `-profile docker`
give `--repgenr_opts '--container docker --bin-dir gubbins=/p/bin'`.

### Container profiles in Nextflow

`nextflow run nextflow/main.nf -profile docker` (or `singularity`, `wave`) sets
`params.repgenr_opts` so every stage calls `repgenr --container …`. On HPC,
Singularity is the clean target (RepGenR dispatches each tool to Singularity);
stacking with Nextflow's own Docker engine implies docker-in-docker.

## Troubleshooting

- **`MissingBinaryError` / a tool is not found.** The Python package does not
  install the bioinformatics tools (see [install.md](install.md)). Put the tool
  on `PATH` from a conda environment. Run
  `repgenr list-tools` to see the adapters and each tool's declared genome
  limit (`list-tools --check` also runs every adapter's preflight and reports
  which binaries are missing or too old) and `--container docker` (or
  `singularity`) to run tools in pinned images instead.
- **Apple Silicon / arm64.** BioContainers are amd64; pass
  `--platform linux/amd64` (and enable Rosetta) so emulated images run.
- **A stage failed; where are the details?** Errors print a concise message; the
  full traceback is in `<workdir>/repgenr.log`. A failed external tool prints one
  line naming the tool and its exit status; the command line and the output
  tail are in the same log. Re-run with `--verbose` to see them on the console
  (a data-channel step has no log and always prints the tail).
  A tool command line is shortened on the console, with or without
  `--verbose`, so that the whole line fits 120 columns: a run of input paths
  is shown as its first path and a count, then other paths by their last
  component, then the run as its count alone and other paths as `...`. A path
  that directly follows an option (`--reference ref.fasta`) is that option's
  value and is not counted with the inputs. Under `--container` the console
  shows the tool's own command; the engine options (mounts, labels, user) are
  in the run log. Long lists of genome names show
  the first five and a count. The full text of such a line, and the tool's own
  output, are in `repgenr.log`.
  `repgenr status -wd <WD>` shows what completed and what is next; a stage
  that failed is listed as `[interrupted]` and its outputs may be partial
  until it is re-run. A finished stage is listed as `[stale]` when one of its
  inputs changed or one of its outputs is missing since it finished; it
  re-runs on its next invocation. A finished stage whose record holds no
  resume fingerprint (written by an older version, or restored by
  `derep-stock --action unpack`) stays `[done]` with a note that its next
  invocation recomputes it. `doctor` warns about every completed record
  without a fingerprint, stale ones included; `status` adds the note only to
  `[done]` lines, since a `[stale]` line already says the stage re-runs. When
  `repgenr.yaml` records no stage, `status` names the entry stages (and
  suggests `doctor` when the workdir holds outputs); when it records stages
  but no entry stage, `status` follows the stages all pipelines share
  (dereplicate, phylo, tree2tax) under "Pipeline: unrecorded entry stage".
- **GTDB download fails.** Check `--release` (e.g. `232.0`) and `--gtdb-version`
  (`bac120`/`ar53`); transient HTTP errors are retried automatically. A host
  that does not accept a connection within 15 s counts as unreachable, so a
  blocked network exits 3 after about two minutes of retries. The
  `--source api` mode fetches only the target taxon (no full-table download).
- **Genomes NCBI no longer serves.** A GTDB release can list assemblies that
  NCBI has since suppressed. `genome` records them in `missing_accessions.txt`
  (also when a whole download batch consists of them) and later stages excuse
  them; a re-run asks for them again. Each rehydrated genome is checked
  against the package's `md5sum.txt`, and a mismatch is recorded the same way.
  An outgroup NCBI does not serve exits 3; choose another with
  `metadata --outgroup-accession`.
- **NCBI datasets on a blocked network.** Before the first `datasets` call,
  `genome` and `vmetadata` (NCBI Virus source) send one request to
  `api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov` with the 15 s connect timeout. Before each
  `datasets rehydrate`, `genome` sends one request to every host named in
  the package's `fetch.txt` (with datasets 18.x that is again
  `api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov`). When a host cannot be connected to, the stage
  exits 3 at once and names it, instead of waiting through three `datasets`
  attempts of several minutes each. The request uses the proxy settings in
  `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`, as the GTDB and Entrez
  requests and `datasets` itself do. Only a failed connection or a connect
  timeout counts as unreachable. An HTTP error status, a read timeout and a
  TLS error count as reachable. A TLS error can mean only that Python's
  certificate bundle lacks a proxy's certificate authority that the system
  store holds, which `datasets` uses; `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` points Python at
  another bundle. `REPGENR_SKIP_NET_PROBE=1` skips the check. A failure
  later, inside `datasets`, still exits 6. `vgenome` works from the
  `vmetadata` download and makes no network request.
- **NCBI Entrez throttling (viral BV-BRC path).** Set `NCBI_API_KEY` (and
  optionally `NCBI_EMAIL`) to raise the request-rate limit. An HTTP error
  is retried per batch of taxids; a connection error (no network, or the
  host does not answer) stops the lookup at the first batch with exit 3.
- **A tool hangs.** Set `REPGENR_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT=<seconds>` to cap every
  external tool; on expiry the process group is killed with a clear error.
  Under `--container docker` the tool's container is stopped as well.
- **Stopping a run.** Each external tool runs in its own process group,
  together with the helpers it starts (for example IQ-TREE under
  `run_gubbins.py`). On SIGTERM (`kill`, a scheduler), SIGHUP (the terminal
  closes) or Ctrl-C, repgenr sends SIGTERM to every running tool group,
  starts no queued tool, sends SIGKILL to the groups still present after
  5 s, and exits: 143 for SIGTERM, 129 for SIGHUP, and the usual
  `KeyboardInterrupt` for Ctrl-C. The stage is then listed as
  `[interrupted]` and a partial output is removed. A second signal kills the
  tools at once. A signal repgenr starts with as ignored stays ignored, so
  `nohup repgenr ... &` survives the terminal closing. Ctrl-Z suspends the
  tools with repgenr, and `fg` or `bg` resumes them; without a terminal
  (`setsid`, a workflow manager) SIGTSTP has no effect, as for any process
  in that situation. SIGKILL to repgenr cannot be handled, so its tools keep
  running; each tool's process group ID is its own PID, so
  `pkill -g <tool pid>` stops a tool with its helpers. With
  `--container docker`, the container runs with `--init`, so the SIGTERM
  the `docker run` client forwards ends the tool in the container. Each
  container is named `repgenr-<repgenr pid>-<hex>`, and when repgenr is
  stopped it also runs `docker stop -t 0` on the container of the tool
  it was running, so a tool that ignores SIGTERM does not keep running.
  This also applies to containers started from parallel worker threads,
  which delays the exit by about a second (the stops run concurrently). A second signal ends repgenr
  at once and starts one `docker stop -t 0` for all its running
  containers, which completes after repgenr has exited. Each container
  carries the labels `repgenr.pid=<repgenr pid>` and
  `repgenr.host=<host name>`. SIGKILL to repgenr leaves its containers
  running; stop them by label:

  ```bash
  docker ps -q --filter label=repgenr.pid=<repgenr pid> | xargs -r docker stop
  ```
- **Exit codes.** A script can tell the failure classes apart without
  reading the log:

  | Code | Meaning |
  |------|---------|
  | 0 | Success. |
  | 1 | An unexpected error (traceback in the run log). |
  | 2 | Invalid or missing user input (also Typer's own usage errors). |
  | 3 | The working directory does not exist (every command, including `status` and `doctor`) or is missing files or in a bad state, or a request to a remote service (GTDB, NCBI Entrez, NCBI Datasets, BV-BRC, ENA) failed, e.g. because the network is unreachable. `genome` and `vmetadata` on NCBI Virus check that the NCBI Datasets host answers before running the `datasets` CLI; a network failure inside `datasets` is reported as 6 instead. `assemble` and `reads-gather` also exit 3 when every run was excused and nothing was produced; the reasons are in `excused_runs.tsv`. |
  | 3 | The working directory does not exist (every command, including `status` and `doctor`) or is missing files or in a bad state, or a request to a remote service (GTDB, NCBI Entrez, BV-BRC, ENA) failed, e.g. because the network is unreachable. A download run through the `datasets` CLI (`genome`, `vmetadata` on NCBI Virus) reports a network failure as 6 instead. `assemble` and `reads-gather` also exit 3 when every run was excused and nothing was produced; the reasons are in `excused_runs.tsv`. `assemble` then leaves an empty genome set rather than the previous one (except under `--append`), so `dereplicate` also exits 3 instead of running on stale genomes; see [output.md](output.md#when-every-sequencing-run-is-excused). |

When an earlier `assemble` call wrote the genome set and at least one run was judged (rejected by the assembler, polisher or quality gate), `assemble` empties that set, so `dereplicate` also exits 3 instead of running on stale genomes; a set written by another stage, or one kept because every run failed to download, stays in place. See [output.md](output.md#when-every-sequencing-run-is-excused). |
  | 4 | A required external tool is absent or below its version floor, or the Docker daemon cannot be reached under `--container docker`. `list-tools --check --strict` exits 4 when any adapter is missing or errored. |
  | 5 | A requested tool adapter could not be found or loaded. `list-tools --check --strict` exits 5 when any plugin failed to load (this takes precedence over 4). |

  | 4 | A required external tool is absent or below its version floor, or the Docker daemon cannot be reached under `--container docker`. |
  | 5 | A requested tool adapter could not be found or loaded. |
  | 6 | An external tool failed (one console line; the command and output tail are in `repgenr.log`). Under `REPGENR_PROPAGATE_TOOL_EXIT=1` (set by the Nextflow modules) the tool's own status is forwarded instead, a signal kill as 128 plus the signal number. |
  | 7 | `doctor` found at least one failure: an output that disagrees with its record, a malformed `repgenr.yaml`, or a check that could not complete. Warnings alone exit 0. |
