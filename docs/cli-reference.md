# Command reference

Generated from the command tree by `scripts/render_cli_matrix.py`; the
matrix test keeps it in sync. Commands are grouped as in `repgenr --help`.
Global options go before the command name
(`repgenr --container docker dereplicate ...`).

A few option names differ between commands. `--tool` selects the
dereplicator on `run` and the derep commands but the SNP typer on `snptype`
(`--snptyper` on `phylo`, `run` and `phylo-build`). `run --metadata-source`
and `run --viral-source` correspond to `metadata --source` and `vmetadata
--source`. The global `--platform` is the container platform, while
`run --platform` filters the sequencing platform. On the step commands
`--outgroup-accession` takes a file that names the accession.

## Global options

| option | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `--version` | off | Show version and exit. |
| `--container` | `none` | Run external tools in containers: none, docker, or singularity. |
| `--container-engine` |  | Engine binary override (e.g. apptainer, podman). |
| `--container-cache` |  | Directory for Singularity .sif images and their cache (large; can be external). |
| `--platform` |  | Container platform, e.g. linux/amd64 for emulated BioContainers on arm64. |
| `--wave`, `--no-wave` | off | Resolve images for multi-tool adapters via the Seqera Wave CLI. |
| `--bin-dir` |  | Put DIR first on PATH for one tool only, e.g. gubbins=ENV/bin for a satellite conda environment. Repeatable; also REPGENR_BIN_DIRS='tool=dir,tool=dir'. |
| `--force`, `-f`, `--no-force` | off | Re-run a stage even if it already completed with the same parameters. |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | off | Verbose (DEBUG) logging. |
| `--quiet`, `-q` | off | Only warnings and errors. |

## Pipeline

### run

Run the whole pipeline end to end (bacterial by default, --viral for viruses).

Some option names differ from the single commands. Here --tool selects the
dereplicator, while 'snptype --tool' selects the SNP typer (--snptyper on
phylo, run and phylo-build). --metadata-source is 'metadata --source' and --viral-source
is 'vmetadata --source'. --platform filters the sequencing platform with
--reads, while the global --platform sets the container platform.

### status

Show which pipeline stages have completed in a working directory.

A completed stage is listed as stale when one of its inputs changed or
one of its outputs is missing since it finished (it re-runs on its next
invocation), and as interrupted when it did not finish. A -wd that does
not exist exits 3; an existing directory without repgenr.yaml prints
which entry stage to run first and exits 0. With --json, a malformed
record still exits 3 and leaves stdout empty.

| option | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `-wd`, `--workdir` | required | Working directory. |
| `--json` | off | Print one versioned JSON object on stdout instead of the text report (schema in docs/output.md); exit codes are unchanged. |

### census

Count the genera, species and samples under a taxon (read-only).

Without -wd, queries a GTDB family (-tf) or genus (-tg) through the GTDB
API or a GTDB metadata table, optionally with the ENA sequencing runs
(--runs), or a viral taxon through NCBI Virus (--viral --target; metadata
only, no sequences). With -wd, counts the candidates the entry stage found
or the genomes it selected, by source; -tf and -tg narrow the count. A
family is counted per genus and a genus per species. No stage is recorded
and nothing is written to a working directory. Exits 2 for a missing taxon
or an unsupported combination, 3 when a request fails or -wd does not exist.

| option | default | description |
|---|---|---|

| `-r`, `--release` |  | GTDB release of the table source, e.g. 232.0. |
| `--gtdb-version` |  | GTDB table of the table source: bac120 (default) or ar53. |
| `--metadata-path` |  | Read this GTDB metadata table (.tsv.gz) instead of downloading the release table; with -wd, the table to count the candidates from. |
| `--runs` | off | Also count the ENA whole-genome sequencing runs under the taxon: runs, biosamples and runs per platform (bacterial taxa only). |
| `--host` |  | With --viral: only records from this host species. |
| `--complete-only` | off | With --viral: only sequences marked complete. |
| `--released-after` |  | With --viral: only records released after this date (MM/DD/YYYY). |

### glance

Quick all-vs-all ANI overview (dendrogram + similarity plots).

Needs dRep or sourmash (on the PATH, or via the container backend) and
no dereplication; compares every genome in genomes/ and writes
glance_clustering_dendrogram.pdf and two ANI plots,
glance_MASH_ANI_similarity_boxplot.png and
glance_MASH_ANI_similarity_histogram.png. dRep reports Mash ANI;
sourmash reports the k-mer ANI estimate that dereplicate --tool
sourmash thresholds.

| option | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `-wd`, `--workdir` | required | Working directory. |
| `--tool` | `auto` | Dereplicator with comparison support: auto, drep, sourmash. auto uses dRep when it can run (on the PATH or via the container backend), otherwise sourmash. |
| `-t`, `--threads` | `16` | Threads for the external tool (default 16, or the CPU limit when lower). |
| `--plot-max` | `1.0` | Upper bound of the ANI values plotted, as a fraction from 0 to 1. |
| `--plot-min` | `0.0` | Lower bound of the ANI values plotted, as a fraction from 0 to 1. |
| `--keep-files` | off | Keep the comparison tool's working directory glance_wd/. |

### cluster-summary

Regenerate derep/cluster_summary.tsv (size, species, keeper quality per cluster).

n_members counts the genomes under the representative and excludes it;
n_genomes includes it. Species come from the manifest taxonomy, or from
canonical filenames when the manifest has none, and at most five are
listed.

| option | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `-wd`, `--workdir` | required | Working directory. |

### derep-unpack

Explode clusters into one directory per representative.

| option | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `-wd`, `--workdir` | required | Working directory. |
| `--no-representant` | off | Leave the representative out of its cluster directory. |

### derep-stock

Store, load, list or delete named dereplication runs.

| option | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `-wd`, `--workdir` | required | Working directory. |
| `--action` | required | list, pack, unpack or delete. |
| `--name` |  | Run name for pack/unpack/delete: up to 100 letters, digits, '.', '_' or '-', starting with a letter or digit. |

### sketch

Write the sourmash sketch of each genome to sketches/.

One file per genome, sketches/<name>.sig.zip, with DNA signatures at
k=21, 31 and 51 (scaled=1000) named after the genome. Only missing and
stale sketches are written (stale: the FASTA or the parameters changed);
sketches of genomes no longer in the set are removed. repgenr --force
sketch writes every sketch again. Needs sourmash (on the PATH, or via the
container backend).

| option | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `-wd`, `--workdir` | required | Working directory. |
| `-t`, `--threads` | `16` | Threads for the external tool (default 16, or the CPU limit when lower). |

## Environment and diagnostics

### list-tools

List the available pluggable tools in each family.

A tool that declares a recommended scale is shown as 'name (up to N
genomes)'; auto-selection and the scale warnings use the same limit.
The last line names the dereplicators that glance can run.
With --check, every adapter's required binaries are looked up (version
floors included) and reported per tool, so an environment can be
verified before a run without a working directory. Under a container
backend each line names where the tool runs: '[image <ref>]' or
'[host]'; --images adds, for each tool that passed, whether its images
(secondary ones such as racon's minimap2 included) are present
locally. A version query that does not answer within 8 s is stopped,
and the version is shown as unknown unless the tool's conda package
record names one. --check alone
always exits 0, since a host that has only some families installed is
normal; --check --strict exits 4 when any adapter is missing or errored,
or 5 when any plugin failed to load, so a script can verify an
environment.

| option | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `--check` | off | Run each adapter's preflight and report whether its binaries are present. |
| `--strict` | off | With --check, exit 4 when an adapter is missing or errored and 5 when a plugin is broken, after the full listing. |
| `--images` | off | With --check under a container backend, also report whether each tool's image is present locally (docker image inspect or the Singularity .sif cache; nothing is pulled). |

### doctor

Verify a workdir's outputs against its records (read-only health check).

`status` lists each stage as done, stale or interrupted; `doctor` also
checks the outputs themselves: missing, corrupt or untracked genomes,
dangling links, manifest drift, representative/cluster mismatches,
truncated tree and tree2tax tables, missing deliverables, stages whose
inputs changed since completion, and leftover temp files.
Exits 0 when only warnings are found (a stale stage re-runs on its next
invocation), 7 when any failure is found (including a malformed
repgenr.yaml or a check that could not complete), 3 when the workdir
does not exist, and 1 only on an unexpected error.

| option | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `-wd`, `--workdir` | required | Working directory. |
| `--quick` | off | Skip reading the first bytes of each genome file (the FASTA content check), the slowest check on large genome sets. Links, missing and untracked genomes are still checked. |
| `--json` | off | Print one versioned JSON object on stdout instead of the text report (schema in docs/output.md); exit codes are unchanged. |

### versions

Print the external-tool versions recorded in a workdir's repgenr.yaml.

One 'tool: version' line per tool. A tool that stages recorded with
different versions (an image in one, the host binary in another) is listed
once per stage as 'tool (stage): version'. A containerized tool's version
is its image reference. A stage that did not finish is named on stderr.

Lets the Nextflow bridge modules (which run a full stage in a scratch
workdir) surface the resolved tool versions into versions.yml.
